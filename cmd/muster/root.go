It exists so host tooling stops reaching into Postgres for things the API
already answers: ` + "`agent resolve <name>`" + ` turns an agent name into its id over
GET /api/agents, and every request path is refused before it is sent if a path
parameter is empty (the doubled-slash 301 class).

Config, lowest to highest precedence:
  ` + defaultEnvFile + `  ->  environment  ->  --api-url / --token
The token is read from ` + envToken + ` only. It is never accepted as a positional
argument (argv is world-readable via /proc) and is never printed.

TWO COMMAND FAMILIES REACH TASKS, AND THEY ARE NOT ALIASES.
  ` + "`task …`" + `        takes an explicit task id and attributes writes from the
                   provenance headers. This is the family for host tooling.
  ` + "`agent task …`" + `  carries NO id: the credential IS the identity, and the
                   server resolves which task is bound to the caller. This is
                   the family for a muster-dispatched agent working inside its
                   own instance. It authors comments as the agent and its status
                   route REFUSES ` + "`complete`" + `, which the id-bearing one allows.
