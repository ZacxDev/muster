// chiefAskRoute is a TEMPLATE for the reason agentMessagesRoute is: an empty

// chiefDefaultName is the agent slug `chief ask` resolves by default.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A SECOND COPY OF agents.ChiefName, AND THE DRIFT IS GUARDED FROM THE
// OTHER SIDE rather than by a build edge. Importing internal/agents to reach the
// original links pgx and its tree into a binary that never opens a database.
//
// ⚠ THE SIZE COST IS THE WEAKER HALF OF THE ARGUMENT, AND IT IS STATED AT WHAT
// WAS ACTUALLY MEASURED rather than at what it felt like: +457,106 bytes, 4.6%
// of the stripped-of-nothing artefact (9,986,494 -> 10,443,600, `go build -o`,
// one file adding the import and one reference). That alone would not decide it.
// What decides it is the BUILD EDGE: a client that links a store package invites
// the next reach for a symbol from it, and this project's whole claim is that the
// two halves are separable.
//
// The copy is safe only because the pin is BIDIRECTIONAL —
// TestTheChiefDefaultNameMatchesTheServers imports internal/agents from a TEST
// file and fails when the two disagree in EITHER direction. A one-directional
// pin is what made the upstream status-vocabulary copy a real defect, and that
// one was correctly resolved by importing instead. The difference is the pin,
// not the taste.

// 🔴 THE FAMILY IS A DIRECTION, NOT A SERVICE, AND ONLY ONE OF ITS TWO
// DIRECTIONS LIVES HERE. Upstream `chief` held both: ASKING (operator -> agent)
// and WRITING (agent -> a terminal pane, approval-gated). The write half stayed
// with the upstream CLI along with the routes it calls, so this binary carries
// the ask half alone. It is kept as a family rather than flattened to a
// top-level verb because the name is what callers already type, and because a
// verb that grows a sibling later should not move.

--agent addresses ANY provisioned agent, not only the default; it merely
DEFAULTS to ` + chiefDefaultName + `. It is resolved over GET /api/agents first, so an absent or
ambiguous name — or a display name rather than a slug — is settled here rather
than becoming a request aimed at the wrong agent.

🔴 IT NEEDS ONE CREDENTIAL, AND BOTH ITS STEPS PRESENT THE SAME ONE. GET
/api/agents is behind requireHookToken and POST /api/agents/{name}/messages
behind requireArmedHookToken; both compare against the server's single shared
secret, so both use ` + envToken + `.

⚠ THE TWO WRAPPERS DIFFER IN THE UNCONFIGURED CASE, and the difference is
visible from here: on a server with no ` + envToken + ` configured the ROSTER
READ is served open (enforce-when-set, back-compat for callers that predate the
token) while the WRITE answers 503 and this verb exits 9, not 3 — the remedy is
to arm the server, not to fix your token.

The message lands in the same transcript the operator sees on the agent's detail
page — and the same chat session ` + "`agent messages <name>`" + ` reads by default —
so a conversation held here is readable afterwards. The response carries
` + "`agent`, `agentId` and `sessionId`" + ` beside the reply, so which agent answered
is in the output rather than inferred.`,
