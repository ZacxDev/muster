// 🔴 WHAT THESE TWO GUARDS CLAIM, AND WHAT THEY DO NOT.
//
// The FIRST is a real two-way relationship: every exit code this binary can
// return is documented, and every documented code exists. It is structural — it
// reads the constants out of exit.go's AST — and it is the guard worth having.
//
// The SECOND is narrower than the defect it descends from, and says so. The
// upstream version of this help text SHIPPED TRUNCATED: one entry ended on the
// word "which" and the next entry began, so `--help` printed half a sentence.
// Nothing saw it, because the only assertion was that four substrings were
// present — and a substring assertion cannot see what comes AFTER the substring.
// This catches an entry that ends on a DANGLING FUNCTION WORD, which is the
// shape that truncation had. A truncation ending on a noun walks straight past
// it. It is here because it is cheap and it fires on the exact mutant, NOT
// because it proves the help is complete. Nothing mechanical can prove that.
//
// ⚠ A TERMINAL-PUNCTUATION RULE WAS CONSIDERED AND IS WRONG FOR THIS TEXT.
// Several entries deliberately end without a full stop, so that guard would be
// red on arrival — a permanently-red gate, which is worse than no gate.
