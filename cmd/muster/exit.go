// Exit codes are part of this CLI's contract with scripts. They must stay

// point of having more than "0 or 1".
//
// ⚠ THE SET IS DUPLICATED FROM THE UPSTREAM CLI THIS ONE WAS EXTRACTED FROM,
// DELIBERATELY AND WITH THE SAME NUMBERS. The two binaries speak to two
// services and share no code, but a caller that drives both — a hook script, a
// harness, an agent — branches on one table. Renumbering here would make the
// same integer mean two things depending on which binary answered, which is a
// worse failure than the duplication.

	// them apart: the first is fixed by arming the server, the second by
	// retrying, the third by fixing a token.
	//
	// 🔴 THE 503 IT MAPS FROM IS NOT AN OUTAGE, AND THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE
	// BODY RATHER THAN THE STATUS. Nearly every hook-tier route is
	// enforce-when-set, so a 503 there really is a sick backend and stays
	// exitServerError. api.requireArmedHookToken is the exception — it is
	// fail-CLOSED and marks its refusal with api.HookUnarmedField. Folding that
	// into exitServerError would report "the server broke" about a server doing
	// exactly what it was built to do. See unarmedHookSurface.
	exitUnarmed = 9 // a SERVER-side surface is not armed (503)
	// exitAborted is its own code because "THIS CLIENT stopped waiting" is not a
	// statement about the network, and folding it into exitNetwork (6) reports
	// "network unreachable" for a deadline that simply elapsed.
	//
	// 🔴 THE DISTINCTION IS OPERATIONAL, NOT COSMETIC. On exitNetwork nothing
	// reached the server, so a retry is free. On exitAborted the request DID
	// leave this process and its outcome is unknown here, so a blind retry can
	// repeat a write that already landed. The remedy is a longer --timeout.

const exitCodeHelp = `Exit codes:
  0  success
  1  server error (5xx)
  2  usage error (bad flags, ambiguous agent name, empty path parameter)
  3  auth failure (401/403) — the server examined the credential this request presented
     and rejected it. The message names the variable to check; the value is never printed
  4  not found (404 on a known route)
  5  conflict (409 — e.g. editing an in-progress task)
  6  network unreachable (DNS, connection refused, a broken connection) — nothing
     arrived, so a retry is free. A DEADLINE is 10, not this
  7  route absent (404 from the router: this client is newer than the server it called)
  8  non-JSON response where JSON was expected (an auth portal or a proxy error page)
  9  a SERVER-side surface is not armed — not an outage, and not your credential,
     which was not even checked. The write half of ` + "`chief ask`" + ` is fail-CLOSED
     (it answers 503 carrying ` + "`\"unarmed\": true`" + `), so a server with no hook token
     configured lands here. Arm the server; do not rotate your token
 10  THIS CLIENT gave up waiting (its --timeout, or a cancelled context) — the request
     DID leave this process, so its outcome is unknown here. Raise --timeout rather than
     retrying blindly, because a write that already landed would be repeated

Output discipline: JSON goes to stdout and NOTHING else ever goes to stdout.
Diagnostics, warnings and version-skew notices go to stderr, so piping stdout
into ` + "`jq`" + ` can never be corrupted.`
