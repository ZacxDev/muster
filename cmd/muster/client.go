// buildVersion is the muster SERVER version this CLI was built against. The
// linker accepts an override here (-ldflags "-X main.buildVersion=1.2.3"), but
// that spelling appears NOWHERE in this repository.
//
// 🔴 NOTHING IN THIS TREE STAMPS IT, AND THE SERVER'S HALF IS STAMPED, SO THE
// ASYMMETRY IS AT RELEASE TIME RATHER THAN IN THE DEFAULTS. Dockerfile's build
// stage links the server with
// `-X github.com/ZacxDev/muster/internal/api.BuildVersion=${VERSION}`, which is
// what /health reports; flake.nix links this binary with buildRevision ONLY;
// `make build`, `make verb-ledger` and every nix-built CLI therefore ship
// buildVersion == "dev". warnSkew compares THIS literal against /health, so
// against any released server — /health answering a real semver — the note
// fires on EVERY command. That is not a drift to be fixed in the defaults:
// closing it means stamping this variable at release, which is a separate
// change nothing here makes.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THE DEFAULT PIN STILL BUYS, since it cannot be the release story:
// TestTheCLIBuildVersionDefaultMatchesTheServers holds this literal equal to
// api.BuildVersion's own default, so an UNSTAMPED server — `make run`,
// `go run ./cmd/muster-server`, the whole local loop — stays silent instead of
// reporting skew against a client that matches it. That import is TEST-ONLY:
// the shipped binary does not link the server.
//
// 🔴 ITS VALUE NAMESPACE IS THE SERVER'S — A SEMVER — AND A GIT REVISION MUST
// NEVER BE STAMPED HERE. This is the variable warnSkew COMPARES against
// /health, and it is the unlabelled first half of what cliVersion() renders. A
// revision in it is therefore both a comparison that cannot be made — "0.2.2"
// against "ba6698e" is not older, newer, or equal — and a git rev printed
// where a reader expects a server version, with no "rev" label to say so.
// buildRevision below exists so provenance has its own variable instead of
// borrowing this one.
var buildVersion = "dev"

// buildRevision is the git revision of the source tree THIS BINARY was linked
// from — provenance, NOT a version, and deliberately a second variable.
//
// 🔴 IT ANSWERS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM buildVersion AND IS NEVER COMPARED TO
// THE SERVER. "Which muster is installed here?" is asked during incidents by
// someone holding the artefact and not the nix store, and before this existed
// the only answer was `readlink -f` on the binary: flake.nix records the
// revision in the DERIVATION NAME (`muster-cli-ba6698e`), which the program
// could not reach. flake.nix now stamps it here instead
// (-ldflags "-X main.buildRevision=<rev>"), cliVersion composes it into what
// ALL THREE human-facing surfaces print — `--version`, the route-absent 404 and
// the skew note — and tests/cli-version-stamp.sh asserts it against the built
// artefact's own output.
//
// ⚠ NEVER COMPARED does not mean never PRINTED. It is printed beside the
// server's version on two of those three surfaces, which is why it is printed
// LABELLED; see cliVersion below.
//
// ⚠ EMPTY IS THE SUPPORTED DEFAULT, not a defect: a plain `go build` — which is
// what `make build`, `make verb-ledger` and every CI job on a runner with no nix
// produce — stamps nothing, and cliVersion omits the clause rather than printing
// an empty one.
var buildRevision = ""

// cliVersion is the string EVERY human-facing surface renders: cobra's
// `--version`, the route-absent 404, and the skew note. It is the ONE place the
// two values above are allowed to meet, and it LABELS them rather than letting
// one stand in for the other.
//
// 🔴 THE LABEL IS THE POINT, AND IT IS WHY LABELLING — NOT OMITTING — IS THE
// ANSWER ON ALL THREE SURFACES. `muster version dev (rev ba6698e)` says which
// server version the client was built against AND which tree produced the
// binary; `muster version ba6698e` — this field carrying whichever value the
// build system happened to stamp — reproduces inside `--version` exactly the
// ambiguity the split above removes. The same arithmetic applies to the two
// operator surfaces: printing buildVersion ALONE there renders a bare "dev",
// from which an operator can conclude nothing, where the labelled form hands
// them a revision they can `git log` to establish staleness. The revision is
// strictly more actionable, and the label is what stops it being mistaken for
// the server version sitting beside it.
//
// ⚠ IT CAN RETURN "", AND NOTHING IN THIS PACKAGE PREVENTS THAT. cobra DISABLES
// the --version flag entirely when Version is empty, so an empty return deletes
// the flag rather than printing nothing. This used to be written here as an
// invariant — "it must never return the empty string" — justified by "a build
// that blanks buildVersion still leaves the (rev …) clause", which is an
// ASSUMPTION, not a guarantee: nothing requires a blanking build to also stamp
// a revision. Measured at 8ad413e: `go build -ldflags="-X main.buildVersion="`
// with no revision produces a binary whose `--version` answers
// `muster: unknown flag: --version` and exits 2.
//
// No in-process test can refuse that, because every Go test in this package
// compiles without release ldflags and observes the defaults. What DOES refuse
// it is the nix derivation's installCheckPhase: tests/cli-version-stamp.sh's
// marker control greps the binary's own output for a `<name> version <value>`
// line and exits 1 naming "the binary has no --version flag" when it is absent.
// That is the right place for the check — the hazard is created by ldflags, and
// that script is the only reader that sees a linked artefact.
