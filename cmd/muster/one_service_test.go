// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE BASE URL IS SUFFICIENT — CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED.
//
// 🔴 THIS IS THE GUARD FOR TWO STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THE EXTRACTION PLAN NAMED,
// AND NEITHER IS VISIBLE IN A GREEN BUILD.
//
//  1. config.apiURL is a SINGLE base URL. The upstream CLI had the same shape
//     while its verbs were about to straddle two services, which would have
//     made every verb aimed at the second one land on the first — as a 404 from
//     a router that has never heard of the route, i.e. exit 7, "this client is
//     newer than the server". A confident, wrong diagnosis.
//  2. client.warnSkew probes /health ONCE against a pinned buildVersion and
//     therefore ASSUMES ONE SERVER. With verbs spread over two, the note would
//     be a statement about whichever process happened to answer /health, and it
//     would be wrong about the other one silently and forever.
//
// Both problems have the same precondition — this binary talks to more than one
// service — and this test is what makes that precondition FALSE rather than
// merely unlikely. It runs every verb, reads the routes the server ACTUALLY
// received, and demands that each be in the server's own committed route table.
//
// ⚠ IT READS THE GOLDEN, NOT THE SERVER'S SOURCE, AND THAT IS THE THIRD
// STRUCTURAL PROBLEM RESOLVED. Upstream, the CLI's tier ledger scanned
// internal/api's source for route literals, which welded the CLI package to the
// server package: the CLI could not be split out without that test dying.
// internal/api/testdata/routes.golden is a committed ARTEFACT, regenerated and
// reviewed by its own gate in internal/api, so reading it couples this file to
// a checked-in file rather than to another package's AST.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM: nothing here says a route is on the right AUTH
// TIER. The golden's own header says it does not record auth wrappers. This is
// a reachability guard, and that is all.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// package.
