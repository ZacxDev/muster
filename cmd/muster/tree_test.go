// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE VERB LEDGER.
//
// 🔴 EXACT EQUALITY, IN THREE DIRECTIONS, AND EACH ONE CATCHES A DIFFERENT
// MISTAKE. This binary's verb set was decided in the extraction plan: twelve,
// named. Anything that changes that set has to change this file, which is a
// line a reviewer reads.
//
//	(1) len(registered) == wantVerbCount     — a verb cannot be ADDED silently,
//	                                           even WITH a ledger row, because
//	                                           the count is pinned to the number
//	                                           the plan names rather than to
//	                                           len(wiring).
//	(2) len(wiring)     == wantVerbCount     — and the ledger cannot drift from
//	                                           it either.
//	(3) the two NAME SETS are equal          — so a verb cannot be renamed, and
//	                                           a ledger row cannot name a verb
//	                                           that does not exist.
//
// ⚠ PINNING ONLY len(registered) == len(wiring) IS THE WEAK FORM, AND IT IS THE
// ONE THE UPSTREAM LEDGER USED. Under it, adding a verb and adding its ledger
// row in the same commit passes — which is exactly how a set that was supposed
// to be a decision becomes a default. The literal below is the decision.
//
// And each row is asserted by EXERCISING the command and observing which route
// the fake server actually received. Asserting existence alone would prove only
// that a name is registered; this proves the name reaches an endpoint.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// wantVerbCount is the number of verbs this binary is specified to have.
//
// 🔴 CHANGING IT IS A DESIGN DECISION, NOT A TEST FIX. The extraction split the
// upstream CLI's verbs between two binaries; this half is: task ls/get/create/
// status/comment, agent ls/resolve/messages, agent task get/comment/status, and
// chief ask. If a thirteenth is genuinely wanted, change this number, add its
// ledger row, and say so in the commit — do not discover it in a diff.
const wantVerbCount = 12

// minRunnableCommands is a hardcoded floor BELOW wantVerbCount. It exists so
// that a tree wired to NOTHING cannot pass this file vacuously: a tree that lost
// its subcommands would count 0 and fail here with a message about the wiring
// rather than about the ledger.
const minRunnableCommands = 8

// wiring is the command -> route map.
