// TestTheRetractedReachabilityClaimIsGoneFromEveryNonTestSource is the sweep half,

// 🔴 A RETRACTION IS A SWEEP OVER THE WHOLE TREE, AND MINE WAS AN EDIT WHERE I WAS
// LOOKING. The round that corrected the banner left "The two CHAT ROUTES are live" in
// doc_seams.go — the one document the corrected banner POINTS A READER AT. The sweep
// that missed it was a lowercase fixed-string grep.
//
// 🔴 AND THE GUARD WRITTEN TO FIX THAT WAS ITSELF WALKABLE, MEASURED, TWICE. It matched
// a regexp against raw file bytes over a FOUR-FILE list, so:
//
//   - restoring the sentence WRAPPED one word earlier survived, because the pattern
//     forbade a newline inside the phrase and in the gap — and an ordinary comment
//     rewrap is the likeliest way that text ever comes back;
//   - the same sentence in internal/api/ext.go survived, because that file was not on
//     the list — and ext.go is where api.Gateway is DECLARED, i.e. the single most
//     likely place for a reader to restate it.
//
// It was named "…TREEWIDE" while sweeping 4 of 121 non-test Go files, and its docstring
// claimed "it covers the sources a reader arrives at" and a "narrow and named
// exemption" it did not implement. That is the same defect one level up: a guard
// reading as coverage while providing none.
//
// SO THIS VERSION: every non-test .go file in the module, and the comment text
// NORMALISED first — leading "//" and indentation stripped and lines joined — so a
// wrap cannot hide the phrase. The cost is that it reads the whole tree on every run;
// measured in milliseconds, which is not a reason to check less.
func TestTheRetractedReachabilityClaimIsGoneFromEveryNonTestSource(t *testing.T) {

	// VOCABULARY — AND THE VOCABULARY VERSION WAS MEASURED WALKABLE FOUR WAYS. The first
	// attempt excluded any match containing not/never/no longer/rather than, because the
	// wider sweep had flagged the corrections themselves ("not the same as reachable",
	// "WIRED IS NOT REACHABLE") — the reachability word is present there precisely to be
	// denied, which is the recorded FAIL-CLOSED hyphen trap and runs the DANGEROUS way,
	// pressuring the correction to be reworded to appease the guard.
	//
	// But a negation word ANYWHERE in the match suppressed the hit, and the regexp's
	// match is non-greedy, so the window is exactly where such a word sits. An audit
	// injected four sentences that assert reachability THROUGH a negation and all four
	// survived with the suite green:
	//
	//	"The two chat routes are not merely wired but live."
	//	"The two CHAT ROUTES, never usable before this change, are live."
	//	"The two chat routes no longer refuse and are now fully live."
	//	"The chat routes now serve rather than refuse, and are usable end to end."
	//
	// The first uses this PR's own wired-vs-live vocabulary, i.e. the likeliest way the
	// retracted claim comes back. So the exclusion is INVERTED: only the exact
	// corrections this tree contains are allowed, pinned as literals. Anything else is
	// flagged whether it is negated or not.
	//
	// ⚠ THE COST, NAMED HONESTLY THIS TIME: rewording a correction fires this guard, and
	// the fix is to add the new wording here. That is deliberate — it forces a human to
	// look at the sentence, which is the whole point, and it is the opposite of the first
	// attempt's cost, which was silently allowing a false claim.
	// ⚠ THE THIRD ENTRY IS THE COST THIS GUARD'S OWN HEADER PROMISED, PAID. The banner
	// line it covers used to end "🔴 WIRED IS NOT REACHABLE" and now reads "🔴 WIRED IS
	// NOT VERIFIED REACHABLE", because the two mechanisms behind the old wording are
	// fixed and what remains is missing EVIDENCE rather than a known defect. Inserting
	// one word moved the match out from under the second entry — `isCorrection` compares
	// whole strings in both directions — so the new wording is pinned here, which is
	// exactly the "forces a human to look at the sentence" the note above describes.
