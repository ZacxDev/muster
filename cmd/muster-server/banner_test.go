// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE BOOT BANNER IS A CLAIM, AND TWO OF ITS LINES WERE MEASURED WRONG.
//
// logBanner's own header promises "Each line below is printed whether the thing
// is on or off", because "a silent healthy state and a silent refusing state
// are otherwise byte-identical in the log". Two findings against that promise:
//
//  1. MUSTER_SECURE_COOKIES had NO line in either direction. It defaults FALSE,
//     so a TLS deployment that forgets it hands out a session cookie with no
//     Secure attribute and the banner says nothing at all.
//  2. The router line BLAMED THE WRONG VARIABLE. router.New returns nil when
//     base, token OR actor is empty, so `port.Configured()` is false for all
//     three — and the fallback branch reported "MUSTER_ROUTER_URL is unset" at
//     an operator who had set the URL and forgotten the token. Measured live,
//     with the URL set.
//
// 🔴 THE SECOND IS WORSE THAN A MISSING LINE, WHICH IS WHY IT GETS THE STRICTER
// ASSERTION. A missing line leaves the operator where they were; a line naming
// the wrong variable sends them to re-check the one that was already right.

// TestTheRouterBannerNamesTheVariableThatIsActuallyMissing is the F3 guard.
//
// 🔴 IT ASSERTS THE NEGATIVE TOO, AND THAT IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS. A check
// that the line MENTIONS MUSTER_ROUTER_TOKEN would pass against the old
// two-branch banner the moment anyone added the word anywhere; what was wrong
// was that it ALSO said the URL was unset while the URL was set. So each case
// pins both what must be named and what must not be claimed.
//
// 🔴 AND THE SUBSTRING VERSION OF THAT WAS SATISFIED BY THE BRANCH IT EXCLUDED.
// The configured case asserted `mustContain: {"CONFIGURED", url}` and
// `mustNotSay: {"is unset"}`. But "PARTIALLY CONFIGURED, THEREFORE NOT
// CONFIGURED" CONTAINS "CONFIGURED", and with all three variables set
// missingRouterCredential returns its case-0 sentence, which contains no "is
// unset" — so the partial branch satisfied every assertion of the configured
// case. Measured with an ordinary edit, not a sabotage: move the
// `case a.cfg.RouterURL != "":` arm above `case port.Configured():`, the sort of
// "group the router-URL cases together" tidy-up anybody might make, and a
// FULLY CONFIGURED router boots announcing PARTIALLY CONFIGURED, THEREFORE NOT
// CONFIGURED while the entire suite stays green. Same class as the defect this
// test was written for — the banner reporting the wrong router state — on the
// opposite axis.
//
// 🔴 SO THE WHOLE NORMALISED LINE IS PINNED. When the artifact under test IS
// PROSE, a guard on words is walkable by rewording, and a guard on a word that
// is a substring of its own negation is walkable by doing nothing at all. The
// cost is real and is accepted deliberately: a cosmetic reword of any line below
// fails this test and the wantLine has to be updated with it. That is the price
// of a machine-readable claim about a sentence.
//
// ⚠ mustContain/mustNotSay ARE KEPT ALONGSIDE IT, AND NOT AS BELT-AND-BRACES.
// A pinned line is walkable one way: regenerate the golden. Updating a wantLine
// is a reflex, and the reflex is exactly what a wrong line arrives as — so the
// negatives stay, because "the CONFIGURED line must not say PARTIALLY" is an
// INTENT that survives a reword and a careless re-pin alike.
