	// 🔴 THEY ARE CONFIGURATION AND NOT CONSTANTS FOR THE REASON
	// AgentGatewayModel IS, ONE STEP FURTHER. The sentinel "belongs to the
	// IMAGE"; so does a configuration file's SCHEMA, and so do the executable

	// runtime's identifier is a denied token, so carrying either would be a leak
	// as well as a coupling. internal/agentspec/runtimeconfig.go argues the
	// design at length and records the measurements behind it.
	//
	// 🔴 WHY THEY HOLD CONTENT RATHER THAN A ConfigMap NAME, WHICH IS A
	// DELIBERATE DEPARTURE FROM THE SHAPE THIS WAS ASKED FOR. A name would make
	// muster READ the object from the apiserver, and that costs three things the
	// content form does not: a `get configmaps` permission in muster's own
	// namespace — on a deployment whose single biggest out-of-repo blocker is
	// already RBAC (see provisioner.go prerequisite 1) — a resolution of which
	// namespace muster itself runs in, which nothing here knows today; and an
	// asymmetry between the two drivers, because the `noop` driver exists
	// precisely so the tiers above the provisioner can be developed with NO
	// cluster, and it would then either need in-cluster credentials or silently
	// build a different spec from the `kubernetes` one. With the content
	// projected by valueFrom.configMapKeyRef the operator still edits ONE
	// ConfigMap and `kubectl rollout restart` still applies it, the refusal below
	// is a pure function of the environment, every wiring test can construct the
	// configured state directly, and the spec is identical under both drivers.
	//

	// ClusterRoles, Roles and both kinds of binding, and the `escalate` and `bind`
	// verbs on top of that (they are what the apiserver asks when the rules being

	// grants last and most reluctantly. If naming a driver implied this tier, the
	// first image bump that set MUSTER_AGENT_PROVISIONER would start attempting
	// privileged writes and every grant would fail with a 403 that reads as a
	// muster defect.
	//
	// ⚠ THE EXACT PERMISSION SET IS NOT LISTED HERE, DELIBERATELY. This comment
	// used to name `escalate` and `bind` and nothing else, as did three other
	// files, and that list is INCOMPLETE — it omits every ordinary verb the policy
	// path actually calls, so a Role written from it 403s on the first grant. The
	// set is enumerated once, as data, in
	// internal/provision/k8s.PolicyRBACPrerequisite: 18 of its 22 (resource, verb)
	// pairs are DERIVED from the call sites and guarded against them. Read it there.
	//
	// ⚠ THE OTHER FOUR ARE ASSERTED, NOT DERIVED, AND THIS POINTER USED TO CALL THE
	// WHOLE SET DERIVED. `escalate` and `bind` on `roles` and on `clusterroles` have
	// no call site by construction — they are authorisation checks the apiserver
	// layers on top of an ordinary write, not calls muster makes — so the
	// DERIVATION excludes them. That is not the same as unguarded: the same test,
	// TestTheRBACPrerequisiteMatchesThePolicyCallSites, pins all four EXPLICITLY
	// and pins their ABSENCE on the two binding resources, so dropping one reddens.
	// What nothing here can redden is whether the apiserver really asks them.
	//
	// 🔴 AND LEAVING IT UNSET IS NOT FREE — IT IS THE FAIL-CLOSED SIDE, WHICH IS
	// LOUDER THAN THE OTHER TWO KNOBS' DEFAULTS. api.Extensions.defects treats
	// `Provisioner != nil && Privilege != nil && PrivilegeApply == nil` as a
	// readiness defect, and this deployment builds a privilege store whenever it
	// has a database. So on a deployment WITH a database, naming a provisioner
	// and leaving this unset makes /readyz refuse and the pod is pulled from the
	// Service. That is deliberate: a grant chip claiming a permission the
	// ServiceAccount does not have is a page stating a falsehood.
	//
	// 🔴 THERE ARE TWO WAYS OUT, NOT THREE, AND THIS SENTENCE CLAIMED THREE. It
	// read "the three ways out are this variable, no privilege store, or no
	// provisioner". The middle one is NOT REACHABLE as a configuration: nothing
	// gates the privilege store on a variable of its own — main.go builds it
	// unconditionally inside the `Database != ""` branch — so "no privilege store"
	// means no database, which also drops notes, agents, runbooks and GitHub. The
	// two reachable escapes are this variable and unsetting the provisioner.
	// TestThePrivilegeStoreHasNoKnobOfItsOwn pins the absence this paragraph
	// depends on, and api.Extensions.defects' refusal text now says the same.
	//
	// 🔴 AND UNSETTING IT AGAIN IS AN OUTAGE, NOT A ROLLBACK. Once armed on a
	// deployment with a database and a provisioner, removing this variable puts the
	// pod straight back into the readiness defect — /readyz 503, pulled from the
	// Service, every route dark. Rolling this tier back is a two-variable change
	// (this one and the provisioner, which config.validateProvisioner requires to
