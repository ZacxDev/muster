// Command muster-server is muster's HTTP service: the task board, the agent
// surfaces, the runbooks, the privileges and the machine API, over the Postgres
// database internal/db migrates.
//
// 🔴 IT EXISTS BECAUSE EVERYTHING BELOW IT DID NOT LINK INTO ANYTHING. Before
// this file, `go list -deps ./cmd/...` resolved four packages of this module —
// cmd/muster, cmd/muster-migrate, internal/db and internal/taskstatus — and
// internal/api appeared in ZERO of them. Sixteen of the module's twenty
// packages, including every HTTP handler and every view, were reachable only
// from _test.go files: they compiled, they were tested, and no process could
// ever execute them. The README said so in one place ("there is no server") and
// contradicted itself in another; a reader who saw a non-empty RegisterRoutes
// concluded a running service. TestTheHTTPLayerLinksIntoABinary and
// TestTheServerListensAndServesHealth are what stop that inference being
// available again — the first pins the link graph, the second drives a real
// listener.
//
// Configuration is read from the environment, once, in config.go — which is the
// only place a MUSTER_* name is spelled in this binary.
//
// 🔴 EVERY api DEPENDENCY NOW HAS AN IMPLEMENTATION IN THIS MODULE, AND EACH IS
// STILL OFF BY DEFAULT. This paragraph read "THREE api DEPENDENCIES ARE
// DELIBERATELY LEFT NIL: Provisioner, PrivilegeApply and the ProfileReapplier a
// provisioner may also satisfy. They have no implementation in this module and
// wiring a fake one would be worse than wiring none." All three of those
// sentences were true when written and none is now: internal/agentprovision
// satisfies Provisioner AND ProfileReapplier, internal/agentgateway satisfies
// Gateway, and internal/agentprivilege satisfies PrivilegeApplier. What survives
// is the SHAPE of the argument — a fake is worse than a nil — and the defaults:
// MUSTER_AGENT_PROVISIONER, MUSTER_AGENT_GATEWAY and MUSTER_AGENT_PRIVILEGE_APPLY
// all ship off, so an unchanged deployment gets the same nils it always had. The
// full statement — what, why, the closing condition and who checks it — is in
// doc_seams.go, beside the code it affects, and the boot banner says which tiers
// are in force out loud on every start.

	// combined Provisioner was split into Provisioner (lifecycle) and Gateway
	// (chat), each with its own wrapper, so that a deployment can wire one and have
	// the other keep refusing honestly. A banner that still named one wrapper would
	// be citing a symbol that does not exist — the exact "check it against a symbol"
	// property this line was rewritten to have.
	//
	// 🔴 AND IT IS NOW TWO SENTENCES ABOUT TWO NILS, WHICH IS THE STATE THE SPLIT
	// MADE REACHABLE. A single line describing "agent provisioning" as one thing
	// was true only while both halves were always unwired together. With a
	// lifecycle adapter wired and no gateway, a one-line banner has to pick which

			//   - THE CREDENTIAL. doc_seams entry 1 blocker (2): the bearer is
