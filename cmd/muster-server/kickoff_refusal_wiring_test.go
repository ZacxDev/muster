// THE SEAM BETWEEN THE GATEWAY THIS BINARY RESOLVES AND THE REFUSAL THE ADAPTER
// PERFORMS.
//
// 🔴 BOTH SIDES OF THIS SEAM ARE ALREADY TESTED IN ISOLATION AND THAT IS EXACTLY
// WHY IT NEEDS A TEST. internal/agentprovision pins the refusal against a bool it
// is handed; gateway_test.go pins that naming a runtime produces a gateway and not
// naming one produces nil. Neither builds the combined state, so the wire between
// them — buildAgentPlane passing `gw != nil` into the adapter — is owned by no
// test at all. A plane that always passed true, or always false, satisfies every
// existing assertion in both packages.
//
// ⚠ THE ASSERTIONS ARE BEHAVIOURAL, NOT STRUCTURAL. Config.KickoffDeliverable is
// unexported and reading it by reflection would type-check past a wiring that set
// it from the wrong thing. These tests DISPATCH through the constructed adapter and
// read what happened to the store, which is the only claim that cannot be satisfied
// by a correctly-shaped mistake.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// dispatchRecorder is an agents.Store that answers the two reads the lifecycle
// adapter makes on a dispatch and records every write.
//
// ⚠ IT EMBEDS agents.Store, so any method NOT implemented here is a nil-interface
// panic rather than a zero value — the same choice stubStore makes, for the same
// reason: a dispatch that started calling something new must fail loudly instead of
// passing over a stub.
