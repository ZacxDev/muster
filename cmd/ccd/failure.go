// A failed turn is ALWAYS a non-200 with a JSON body naming a stable type.
//
// 🔴 NEVER A 200 WITH AN EMPTY REPLY. muster's client (internal/agents
// RunToollessTurn) assembles the reply from the stream and returns it with a nil
// error; a 200 whose stream carries no text is, to every caller, "the agent
// answered nothing" — a kickoff recorded as delivered, a chat bubble left blank.
// The CLI itself makes this mistake easy to copy: a 401 shows up in `-p` JSON as
// {"subtype":"success","is_error":true,"api_error_status":401} with exit code 0
// in a pipeline, so neither `subtype` nor the exit status can be trusted.
//
// 🔴 AND NEVER A 404. muster's client maps exactly 404 to "this runtime has no
// /v1/responses" and retries the turn on /v1/chat/completions — which ccd does not
// serve, so a 404 here would turn a real failure into a misleading transport error.
//
// The `type` vocabulary is the contract a muster-side account pool keys on: an
// account whose turns come back `auth_failed` needs a new token; one that comes
// back `rate_limited` is healthy and should be rested until its reset time, which
// the CLI states in `message` ("You've hit your session limit · resets 9:45pm").

// StopFailure hook payload at all — a limit was never hit while recording.
// CLOSING CONDITION: one rate-limited turn through ccd on the pinned CLI, whose
// StopFailure payload and transcript record are captured into testdata/ and
// asserted here; checked by whoever runs the operator live check and first sees
// a limit (the PR that added this file lists the capture step).
