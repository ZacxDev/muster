// The supervisor keeps the interactive CLI running in its tmux pane, IN THE POD:
// an exit (an operator's /exit, a crash) is followed by a restart in the same
// pane, resuming the same conversation, with no pod restart.
//
// 🔴 RESUME, NEVER FORK. Every start is `claude --continue` when the config dir
// already holds a transcript for this workspace, and plain `claude` only when it
// holds none (a genuinely fresh volume). The decision is made by LOOKING at the
// transcripts (hasPriorSession), never by running `--continue` and reading its exit
// code: measured on the pinned CLI, `claude --continue` with nothing to continue
// prints "No conversation found to continue" and exits 1 — but so does any other
// failure, and `--continue || claude` turns every one of them into a NEW
// conversation that silently abandons the old one.
//
// 🔴 A CRASH LOOP IS A POD PROBLEM, AND IS HANDED TO KUBERNETES. Each restart
// waits backoffMin·2^(k-1) (capped at backoffMax), k being the number of exits
// within crashWindow. When crashExits exits fall within crashWindow, the
// supervisor stops restarting and reports `cli: crash_loop`; /healthz then
// answers non-200, so the liveness probe restarts the pod and the restart count
// is visible in `kubectl get pod`. It latches: without a liveness probe (a bare
// `docker run`) nothing restarts it.
//
// 🔴 A LOST TERMINAL IS HANDED TO KUBERNETES TOO, FOR THE SAME REASON. When the
// pane ccd started can no longer be read as ITS pane — the tmux server went away
// (`kill-server`, the last `kill-session`), or one started again on the socket now
// owns that pane id (tmuxTerminal.state) — the supervisor reports
// `cli: terminal_lost`, refuses input, and /healthz fails. It does NOT start a
// new CLI in a new session of its own, because:
//   - it can no longer see the old CLI process: it is nobody's pane, so no tmux
//     will report its exit, and a second `claude --continue` started beside a CLI
//     that survived would be two writers of one conversation — a fork in all but
//     name. A container restart ends every process in the container, so the
//     `--continue` that follows is the only one;
//   - a session named `cc` that ccd did not create belongs to whoever created it,
//     and ccd would have to kill it or work around it to start its own.
//
// The pod's next start resumes the conversation exactly as an in-pod restart
// would: argv() chooses `--continue` whenever a transcript exists. Like
// crash_loop it latches, and without a liveness probe nothing restarts it.
//
// 🔴 EVERY START IS PRECEDED BY THE SEED'S STRIP of settingsForbidden (seed.go
// stripSettingsFile): the entrypoint's `ccd seed` runs once per POD, and the
// in-pod restarts here are where a key written into settings.json since then (an
// operator's /config, the session editing its own config) would otherwise reach
// the next CLI.
