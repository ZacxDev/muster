# The verb ledger, asserted against a BUILT BINARY.
#
# Usage: tests/verb-ledger.sh <path-to-muster-binary>
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS WHEN cmd/muster/tree_test.go ALREADY PINS THE SAME SET.
#
# tree_test.go walks the cobra tree IN PROCESS. It is the stronger check of the
# two — it proves each verb reaches a route — and it is blind to exactly one
# thing: WHICH BINARY A BUILD PRODUCES. Point `subPackages` at the wrong
# directory, get `mainProgram` wrong, or install the server instead of the
# client, and tree_test.go stays green while the artefact a consumer fetches is
# not this CLI at all. That is the seam this file owns: the packaging ↔ verb-set
# relationship, which neither side's own tests can see.
#
# It is also what makes the claim checkable for a consumer who has only the
# artefact: run it against `$(nix build .#muster-cli)/bin/muster`.
#
# 🔴 EXACT EQUALITY, AND IT FAILS WHEN THE SET GROWS *OR* SHRINKS. A `>=` check
# would accept a binary that had gained the whole of the upstream CLI's other
# half (see FORBIDDEN below), and a `<=` check would accept one that had
# silently lost `task comment`. Downstream tooling is being repointed at this
# binary for the task/agent surface, so a dropped verb is a broken session and
# an added one is a split that stopped being a split.
#
# 🔴 WHAT IT STRUCTURALLY CANNOT SEE, so nobody reads a green run as more than
# it is:
#   * It enumerates LEAVES — commands that have no subcommands of their own. A
#     command that is BOTH a group and runnable would not appear. No command in
#     this tree is; tree_test.go's `RunE != nil` walk is the view that would
#     notice if one became so.
#   * It reads `--help` output, so cobra's help FORMAT is a dependency of this
#     script. A format change collapses the parse to an empty set, which fails
#     in the SHRINK direction with a message about the marker — loud, not quiet.
#     The MARKER control below is what makes that distinguishable from a binary
#     that genuinely has no subcommands.
#   * It says nothing about what a verb DOES. tree_test.go asserts the route.

# 🔴 CHANGING IT IS A DESIGN DECISION, NOT A TEST FIX — the same sentence
# cmd/muster/tree_test.go opens with, and the two must agree. The extraction
# split the upstream CLI's verbs between two binaries; this half is the
# task/agent surface below. If a thirteenth is genuinely wanted, add it here,
# add it to tree_test.go's `wiring` with the route it reaches, move
# `wantVerbCount`, and say so in the commit.

# WANT_COUNT is pinned to the number the split SPECIFIES, not to `wc -l` of
# LEDGER. Both are asserted, so adding a verb AND its ledger row in one commit
# still fails until someone moves this literal deliberately. (tree_test.go pins
# the identical number for the in-process tree; they are two reads of one
# decision.)

# CLI this one was extracted from and must NEVER appear here.

# 🔴 THIS LIST IS REDUNDANT WITH EXACT EQUALITY AND IS KEPT ANYWAY. Equality
# already refuses any of these. What the list adds is a NAMED diagnosis: a
# future reader who sees "the router half has leaked into this binary" learns
# what went wrong, where "the verb set grew by 15" only says that it did. It is
# a message, not a second gate — do not read its presence as the thing doing
