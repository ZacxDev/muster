"""Refuse SENSITIVE content in this repository.

muster was extracted from a private, single-operator deployment. The source
material carries live hostnames, private addresses, a container registry, real
task numbers and dated incident narration. This gate exists so none of that can
come back — and so the repository can one day be made public without a hand
audit being the only thing standing between it and the internet.

🔴 THE REPOSITORY IS PRIVATE TODAY AND THIS GATE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT.
A clean run means "the scrub held", not "this is safe to publish". Publication
is a separate decision with a separate review.

🔴 SCOPE: SECURITY, NOT TIDINESS. This blocks the things that would cause harm
if published — credentials, reachable hostnames, real private network
addresses, the specific private identifiers the extraction removed, and dated
incident references. It does NOT police names or dates by heuristic. A gate
that fires hundreds of times for nothing is a gate someone turns off, and then
the real findings ship too.

🔴 A CLEAN RUN IS NOT EVIDENCE UNTIL THE CONTROLS HAVE BEEN WATCHED TO WORK.
A scanner wired to nothing reports zero exactly like a clean tree does, so this
module ships its own controls and runs them on EVERY invocation:

  * NEGATIVE — each rule must refuse a REALISTIC sensitive string. Realistic,
    not a textbook fixture: a scanner that only recognises `example.com` passes
    a real leak, and scanners notoriously allowlist their own canonical
    examples and then scan clean.
  * POSITIVE — the matcher must be able to produce a NON-ZERO count at all.
  * NARROWNESS — legitimate content must NOT be refused, so the gate stays
    usable.
  * SELF-AUDIT — the file this gate EXEMPTS from the scan (see SKIP_FILES) is
    audited by VALUE: every address, hostname, registry reference, credential,
    denied name and dated stamp it spells must be objectively unroutable,
    objectively synthetic, or DECLARED with the reason it is safe. The
    exemption was unaudited for the whole life of the private repository, and
    what hid in it was the LAN address of a real single-node cluster, sitting
    in a negative control that read exactly like its synthetic neighbours.

Exit codes:
  0  no findings (and every control behaved)
  1  findings — sensitive content is present
  2  the gate itself could not run, or a control misbehaved. NOT a pass.

# DENIED IDENTIFIERS — the real project, repository, cluster, host and domain
# names the extraction removed from this tree, so they cannot come back.
#
# 🔴 STORED AS DIGESTS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, NOT A FLOURISH. A
# denylist of private names written out in plaintext is a file that PUBLISHES
# exactly the names it exists to remove — the gate would be the leak, and it
# would be the most-grepped file in the repository. SHA-256 of the lowercased
# identifier lets this file recognise a name it does not contain.
#
# 🔴 WHAT THAT COSTS, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: nobody can verify from inside
# this repository that these digests are digests of the RIGHT strings. That is
# not a defect to fix, it is the property being bought — a set you could audit
# from here would be a set you could read from here. So the controls below
# prove the MECHANISM end to end (tokenise → prefix → digest → refuse) using
# synthetic sentinels that travel the identical code path, and DENIED_COUNT
# pins the set size so it cannot shrink unnoticed.
#
# ⚠ MATCHING IS EXACT OVER `-`/`_` SEGMENT PREFIXES, NEVER SUBSTRING. Each
# identifier-shaped token on the line is lowercased, `_` is folded to `-`, and
# every leading segment run is hashed: `a-b-c` offers `a`, `a-b`, `a-b-c`. So a
# one-word entry catches every compound built on it, while a compound entry
# catches only itself and its extensions.
#
# ⚠ THE ILLUSTRATIONS BELOW USE THE SENTINELS, NEVER A REAL ENTRY. An earlier
# version of this pattern in a sibling project illustrated the rule with two
# real names three lines under "a set you could audit from here would be a set
# you could read from here", and a grep over the public repo still hit them.
# Sentinels only.

#: 🔴 THE GATE DOES NOT SCAN ITSELF, AND THE EXEMPTION IS A REAL HOLE STATED
#: PLAINLY RATHER THAN A TECHNICALITY. This file must CONTAIN a realistic
#: credential, a realistic private address, a realistic lab hostname and a
#: realistic registry reference, because those are its negative controls and a
#: control built from a textbook fixture proves nothing. Scanning itself would
#: therefore refuse itself — 24 findings, every one of them a control doing its
#: job — and the only two ways out are to weaken the controls or to exempt the
#: file. The controls are the thing that makes every clean report meaningful, so
#: the file is exempt.
#:
#: 🔴 WHAT THAT USED TO COST, AND WHAT WAS ACTUALLY LOST: this note used to end
#: "a real leak pasted into THIS file is invisible to this gate. Nothing here
#: closes that. Review a diff by hand." The hand review is what happened, and it
#: is what failed: a `private-ip` negative control carried the LAN address of a
#: real single-node cluster from the first commit of this file, through the
#: pre-publication review, and out into public history. The rule matched that
#: shape, the scan would have refused the line, and the docstring above asserted
#: the fixtures were synthetic — the file was simply never read by anything.
#:
#: 🔴 SO THE EXEMPTION IS NOW NARROW: exempt from the SCAN, audited by VALUE.
#: `audit_exempt_files` below reads every file in this set and holds each
#: sensitive value it spells to one of three bars, failing closed on anything
#: new. What it still accepts is written out there rather than implied here.
#:
#: ⚠ AN EXEMPT FILE IS STILL NAMED IN THE OUTPUT as a SKIPPED line, never
#: silently dropped. A count of files scanned cannot distinguish a clean tree
#: from a partly-read one, which is the ambiguity this accounting exists to
#: remove.
SKIP_FILES = {"tests/leakscan.py"}


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE EXEMPT FILES ARE AUDITED BY VALUE
#
# 🔴 A SCAN EXEMPTION IS A HIDING PLACE, AND SOMETHING HID IN THIS ONE. The
# defect this section exists for was not a broken rule: it was that the one file
# nothing reads is also the one file that must CONTAIN realistic sensitive
# strings, so a real value pasted into the sample lists looks exactly like its
# synthetic neighbours and nothing — not the gate, not the docstring, not the
# pre-publication review — is positioned to tell the difference.
#
# 🔴 THE AUDIT IS ATTACHED TO `SKIP_FILES` ITSELF, NOT TO THIS FILE'S NAME, so
# an exemption can never again be blind: adding a file to that set enrols it
# here, and the audit fails if it cannot read what the set names.
#
# Every value an exempt file spells must clear one of three bars:
#
#   1. OBJECTIVELY UNROUTABLE OR ALREADY ARGUED — a reserved documentation or
#      loopback address needs no argument from anybody (RFC 5737, RFC 1122), and
#      neither does one of the conventional cluster CIDRs already argued for in
#      DOC_ADDRESSES, nor the base address of an RFC 1918 block argued for in
#      DOC_BLOCKS.
#      ⚠ THE LAST OF THOSE IS WIDER HERE THAN IN THE SCAN, AND KNOWINGLY. The
#      scan allows a block base only with its own mask; this audit is held to
#      VALUES, and the value is the dotted quad, so it passes the base whatever
#      follows it. It has to: this file's own negative controls spell the bases
#      with the WRONG mask, on purpose. The cost is that a real subnet written
#      on a block base (`192.168.0.0/24`) inside an exempt file passes this
#      audit — review such a line by hand.
#   2. OBJECTIVELY SYNTHETIC — a dated stamp older than this project can be, and
#      (for denied names) this module's own sentinels. Neither needs judgement.
#   3. DECLARED — everything else must appear in EXEMPT_FIXTURE_VALUES with the
#      reason it is safe. This is the bar that needs a human, and it is the one
#      that would have caught the address: writing `192.168.<real>.<real>` into a
#      table whose every row asserts "this is not anybody's" is a claim somebody
#      has to make in a diff, rather than one more plausible-looking sample line.
#
# 🔴 WHAT THIS STILL ACCEPTS — STATED, BECAUSE A GUARD THAT READS AS COVERAGE
# WHILE PROVIDING NONE IS WORSE THAN NO GUARD:
#
#   * A REAL VALUE DECLARED ANYWAY. Nothing here can tell a real RFC1918
#     address, lab hostname or credential from an invented one; it can only
#     force it to be written down twice, in a table that says why it is safe.
#     The one class where that is not true is the denied names: the only way to
#     declare one is to spell it, in plaintext, in a public file — which is a
#     diff nobody merges by accident.
#   * PROSE. A real incident narrated in a comment or in a fixture's TEXT leaks
#     without spelling any value this audit extracts. That is how a real agent's
#     name and its real symptom rode in beside the address — both in fixtures,
#     only one of them a value. Read fixture text, not only fixture values.
#   * IPv6, and the gate has no IPv6 rule at all: a ULA (`fd00::/8`) address is
#     invisible to every rule above, so it is invisible here too.
#   * EVERY SCANNED FILE'S FIXTURES. This audits the files the gate SKIPS, which
#     is where the blindness was. A Go test fixture is covered by the scan — by
#     the rules the scan has, which is a different and narrower claim than "it
#     contains nothing real".
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: QUESTION TO ASK OF IT: `_PRIVATE_IP` matches 10/8, 172.16/12 and 192.168/16
#: and NOTHING ELSE, so a TEST-NET address in the `private-ip` negative control
#: makes that control inert and the rule stops being watched to go red. The
#: controls therefore have to spell RFC1918 addresses. The only defence left is
#: choosing ones that are demonstrably nobody's, so each was grepped against the
#: deployment muster was extracted from and matched zero files — `10.255.` and
#: `172.20.4.9` and `172.16.4.9`, zero each, against 109 files for the address
#: this replaced.
#:
#: 🔴 EACH ROW IS A CLAIM SOMEBODY MADE. A row is not evidence a value is
#: synthetic; it is a record that a human asserted it, with a reason, where a
#: reviewer can disagree. That is the whole of what this bar buys.
