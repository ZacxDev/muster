# 🔴 EACH ENTRY IS A POSITIVE CONTROL FOR ONE CONTENT GLOB, NOT DECORATION.
# Every class below is written in exactly one place in the tree and is reachable
# ONLY through `./internal/ui/**/*.go`. Measured with that glob deliberately
# pointed at a non-existent directory: Tailwind exits 0, emits a VALID 5,594-byte
# stylesheet instead of the real one, and every class here drops to zero
# occurrences. That is the whole hazard — there is no error, no warning in the
# exit code, and nothing on a developer's machine looks wrong.
#
# ⚠ THE FULL SIZE IS DELIBERATELY NOT RESTATED HERE ANY MORE. This comment said
# "38,274-byte" and the real file was 38,657 by the time anyone measured — a
# hardcoded figure with nothing deriving it does not stay true, it stays
# written. css-check PRINTS the byte count on every run, which is a producer;
# the 5,594 stays because it is a property of the FAILURE mode (an all-globs-miss
# build), not of this tree, and it is the number that makes the point.
#
# ⚠ PLAIN ALPHANUMERIC CLASSES ONLY, AND THAT IS A HARNESS FIX RATHER THAN A
# TASTE. A responsive or opacity-modified class (`lg:pl-72`, `bg-rose-500/95`)
# is escaped in the CSS as `.lg\:pl-72`, and carrying that backslash through
# Make into a shell into grep's pattern language made grep warn about a "stray \
# before :" and match nothing — a MISSING verdict for a class that was present.
# That is the instrument failing, reported as a finding about the code.
# Each of these is written in a different moved view, so the set spans the glob
# rather than sampling one file.
#
# 🔴 THE SIXTH CLASS COVERS A DIFFERENT CONTENT ENTRY, NOT A SIXTH VIEW.
# `bg-emerald-600` is written ONLY in internal/api/login.go — the sign-in page,
# the one document this app emits from outside internal/ui — so it is the
# positive control for that entry. Without it, deleting `./internal/api/login.go`
# from tailwind.config.js would ship a login page with an unstyled submit button
# and every check here would stay green.

test-liveenv: ## run the live-environment controls (needs a real coding-agent session)
	@# These are behind `//go:build liveenv` because they read their inputs from the
	@# REAL process environment. They are NOT in `make test` on purpose: as t.Skip
	@# they silently no-op'd on CI and the run still looked green.
	go test -tags liveenv -run 'REALProcessEnvironment|SessionIDIsReadableFromThisProcess' -v ./cmd/muster/
	@# The agent-chat controls need a reachable agent runtime, not a coding-agent
	@# session — see internal/agentgateway/liveruntime_test.go for the variables
	@# and the port-forward recipe. They are the closing condition the OWED record in
	@# internal/agents/responses.go wrote for itself: the httptest suite proves what
	@# goes on the wire, and only these prove a runtime accepts it.
	@#
	@# 🔴 MUSTER_LIVE_AGENT_EXPECT_TOOLS DECIDES WHETHER A TOOL-CELL FAILURE IS FATAL —
	@# NOT WHETHER THE CELL RUNS. An earlier heading called it "OPT-IN", which described
	@# a first draft that skipped before doing any work: with a runtime declared that
	@# measured nothing while calling itself a measurement. The cell now RUNS whenever a
	@# runtime is declared and reports what it found; the variable only escalates a
	@# failure to the target. It shipped unconditionally red — the tool
	@# cell cannot pass without a runtime that BOTH speaks the shape agents.ToolDef
	@# sends AND has a working model credential, and no single pod had both — with a
	@# comment here pre-excusing the red. A comment excusing a red gate IS the
	@# click-through training claude/RULES.md names, not a defence against it; and it
	@# also made the TARGET'S EXIT CODE unreadable — the cmd/muster cell runs first and
	@# printed its own verdict fine, so what an always-red cell buried was whether the
	@# target as a whole passed. An earlier wording said "the cell's verdict", which is
	@# measurably not what happened.
	@# So: no runtime declared (no ADDR/TOKEN) => skip, nothing to talk to. Runtime
	@# declared => the cell RUNS and reports. Plus EXPECT_TOOLS => a failure is the
	@# target's failure too.

# 🔴 THE SELF-TEST RUNS FIRST, AND THE `&&` IS LOAD-BEARING. A scanner that

# below a measurement rather than a claim.

# 🔴 TAILWIND CANNOT FAIL THE WAY YOU NEED IT TO, SO THIS TARGET FAILS FOR IT.
#
# Tailwind emits rules only for classes it FINDS. A content entry that matches
# nothing is not an error and not a non-zero exit — it silently produces a
# smaller, perfectly valid stylesheet. The page then renders unstyled wherever
# that stylesheet is actually served, which is typically a container and not the
# machine the build ran on, so the first report is "it looks broken in prod".
#
# Two separate claims are checked here, and they fail for different reasons:
#
#   1. THE BUILD STILL REACHES THE VIEWS. Rebuild into a scratch file and assert
#      each class in CSS_REQUIRED_CLASSES is present. A zero here means a content
#      glob stopped matching — the silent case above.
#   2. THE COMMITTED STYLESHEET IS THE ONE THOSE VIEWS PRODUCE. Compare the
#      scratch build against the committed file byte for byte. $(CSS_OUT) is
#      COMMITTED, not gitignored, precisely because a later `go:embed` will make
#      it a build input — and this repository's .gitignore says in its first line
#      that nothing `go build` needs may be ignored, because the project muster
#      came from ignored exactly this file and broke `go build` on a fresh clone.
#      Committing it without this comparison would just move the failure from
#      "missing" to "stale", so both halves ship together.
#
# ⚠ `cmp`, NOT a parsed diff summary. Parsing another tool's output makes its
# FORMAT a dependency; cmp answers the only question here with an exit code.
