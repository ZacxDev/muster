      # The mechanism is the generic hazard of an allowlist: `internal/api`

      # `subPackages` exists to narrow what gets INSTALLED, and

      # too. With `subPackages = [ "cmd/muster-migrate" ]` the walk covers
      # exactly one directory — and `cmd/muster-migrate` contains NO test files
      # at all, so the build log reads
      #
      #     Running phase: checkPhase
      #     ?  .../cmd/muster-migrate  [no test files]
      #     Running phase: installPhase

      # arriving through a build option whose only documented job is something
      # else. (Measured on THIS module, not inherited from the project the style
      # came from: `go test ./cmd/muster-migrate/...` prints exactly that line.)
      #
      # ⚠ AND THE TELL DOES NOT SURVIVE. The `[no test files]` line is what makes
      # it visible. The day `cmd/muster-migrate` gains one test, the same
      # narrowing would run ONE package and print a plausible-looking PASS, with
      # nothing in the log to say the others never ran. The `ok` COUNT below is
      # the instrument that does not depend on that tell.
      #
      # 🔴 `go vet ./...` COVERS THE WHOLE MODULE; `go test` COVERS A NAMED SET,
      # AND THIS IS A NARROWING THAT HAS TO BE JUSTIFIED RATHER THAN INHERITED.
      # `go test ./...` here is NOT the stronger option — it is a RED one, and
      # that was measured rather than supposed. Four packages fail inside the
      # sandbox for reasons that have nothing to do with the code under test:
      #
      #   internal/agentspec   — its autosave tests shell out to `git`, which the
      #                          sandbox has no binary for
      #   internal/modulegate  — reads Dockerfile, .dockerignore and
      #                          tailwind.config.js, i.e. REPOSITORY files that a
      #                          filtered `src` deliberately does not carry
      #   internal/notes       — reads the root-level testdata/ golden vectors
      #   internal/ui          — reads tailwind.config.js and web/css/input.css
      #
      # Every one of those asserts a property of the REPOSITORY, not of the
      # compiled packages, so a derivation whose source is an allowlisted subset
      # structurally cannot run them. Carrying enough of the tree to satisfy them
      # would mean carrying essentially all of it, which is the filter's whole
      # point undone. So the rule here is: a derivation's check phase tests THE
      # PACKAGES IT INSTALLS, and `go vet` reads everything else.
      #
      # 🔴 WHAT THIS PHASE STRUCTURALLY CANNOT SEE, so nobody reads a green nix
      # build as a green suite:
      #   * the four packages above — covered ONLY by the CI `test` job, which
      #     runs against a real checkout with `git` on PATH
      #   * every Postgres-backed test. The sandbox has no network and no
      #     database and `MUSTER_TEST_REQUIRE_DB` is unset, so they SKIP. That is
      #     deliberate — a build that needed a database would not be a build —
      #     but it means this phase covers the pure-Go half only.

      # THE CLI.
      #
      # 🔴 WHY THIS OUTPUT EXISTS, STATED AS THE FAILURE IT CLOSES RATHER THAN AS
      # A FEATURE. `cmd/muster` shipped in-tree with no build output and nothing
      # that installed it, so every consumer reached for the CLI from the project
      # muster was extracted from instead — a DIFFERENT repository, PRIVATE, with
      # its own release cadence. The two then drifted on the provenance headers:
      # the other client sent one spelling, muster's API read the other, and for
      # six days every task comment was attributed to the generic API caller
      # while the task↔session thread recorded NOTHING. The server now accepts
      # both spellings, but that is the symptom's fix. The cause is that the
      # client lived somewhere its server could not gate it.
      #
      # 🔴 AND THE REASON A PACKAGE HELPS IS THAT THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC. The
      # other client can only be packaged from a LOCAL PATH, because fetching a
      # private source would put a credential in the nix store — and a local-path
      # derivation's `vendorHash` is only correct for whichever checkout the host
      # happens to hold, which broke two machines in OPPOSITE directions on one
      # commit. A public flake output is FETCHABLE and pinnable by revision, so a
      # downstream consumer gets the whole class deleted rather than worked
      # around.
      #
      # ⚠ THE BINARY IS `muster` AND THE OUTPUT IS `muster-cli`, DELIBERATELY NOT
      # THE SAME WORD. `cmd/muster` compiles to a binary named `muster` and
      # `mainProgram` must say so or `lib.getExe` points at a path that does not
      # exist. The ATTRIBUTE is a different question: `packages.muster` would be
      # the obvious name for this project's SERVICE (`cmd/muster-server`, which
      # has no output yet and will want one), and reading `packages.muster` as
      # "the client" is a trap worth not setting. `muster-cli` names the thing.
      #
      # ⚠ `cmd/muster/progname.go` MAKES THE BINARY'S OWN NAME NEGOTIABLE, which
      # is what frees this choice. The binary reads `argv[0]` and calls itself
      # whatever it was invoked as — help text, error prefix and version-skew
      # note all follow — precisely so a host can symlink it under a transitional
      # alias and keep command-line-matching hooks armed. So a consumer is not
      # stuck with `muster`: install this and symlink. What that code does NOT do

        # stale, and a binary that reports a different revision from the store
        # path it lives in is worse than one that reports nothing, because it

        # skew note and the route-absent 404. Stamping a revision there made
        # those render "server 0.2.2 … built against ba6698e": a comparison that
        # cannot be made, on the one surface where an operator is reasoning about
        # compatibility. `buildRevision` carries provenance, `buildVersion`
        # carries the server pin that `cmd/muster/server_pins_test.go` holds to
        # `api.BuildVersion`, and `cliVersion()` is the single place they meet —
        # labelled, as `muster version dev (rev ba6698e)`.
        #
        # 🔴 THE SYMBOL PATH IS `main`, NOT `github.com/ZacxDev/muster/cmd/muster`.
        # `cmd/muster` IS a main package, so that is where the linker looks for
        # the variable. This matters because `-X` on a path that resolves to
        # nothing is ACCEPTED SILENTLY — no warning, no failure, just an
        # unstamped binary — which is the same observable as having no `ldflags`
        # at all. The `installCheckPhase` assertion is what tells those apart.
        #
        # ⚠ `internal/api.BuildVersion` IS DELIBERATELY NOT STAMPED HERE. The CLI
        # does not link internal/api (see cmd/muster/server_pins_test.go — that
        # import is test-only, and keeping it so is the project's central claim),
        # so a `-X` against it would be exactly the silently-ignored no-op the
        # paragraph above warns about. The server's version travels with the
        # server: `make image` passes VERSION, per the note on that target.

        # `subPackages` pointing at the wrong directory, or a wrong
        # `mainProgram`, leaves every Go test green while the artefact a consumer
        # fetches is some other program. tree_test.go walks the cobra tree
        # in-process and is blind to packaging by construction; this walks
        # `$out/bin/muster`.
        #
        # It is in the PACKAGE rather than in a separate `checks` attribute for
        # the same reason `doCheck` is: downstream tooling is being repointed at
        # this binary for the task/agent surface, and the guard has to travel
        # with the thing being consumed.
        #
        # ⚠ IT IS REFERENCED AS A STORE PATH, NOT THROUGH `src`. The script is
        # not in `onlyGo`'s allowlist and does not need to be — `${./…}` copies
        # that one file, which also means editing it rebuilds this derivation.
        # `bash` explicitly, because the file's `/usr/bin/env` shebang does not
        # resolve inside the sandbox.
        #
        # ⚠ `doInstallCheck` DOES NOT RUN WHEN CROSS-COMPILING, so a cross build
        # of this package is NOT covered by it. Native builds are.

        #
        # 🔴 IT IS ASSERTED ON THE BINARY'S OWN OUTPUT, NOT ON THE DERIVATION
        # NAME. The name is what was already right and already load-bearing (it
        # is how the installed revision was identified before this change, and it
        # still works); reading it here would re-assert nix's own naming and
        # would stay green for a binary with no `ldflags` at all — which is the

        # whether the override reached the artefact a consumer runs.
