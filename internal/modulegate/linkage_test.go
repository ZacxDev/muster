// Package modulegate holds the gates that are about the MODULE rather than
// about any package in it: what links into a binary, and whether the claims
// this tree's comments make about its own test suite are true.
//
// 🔴 IT IS TEST FILES ONLY, ON PURPOSE. A gate that shipped an exported symbol
// would be a package that itself links into nothing, which is precisely the
// state linkage_test.go exists to detect — the gate would be an instance of the
// defect. `go build ./...` produces nothing here; `go test ./...` runs it.

// THE LINK GRAPH.
//
// 🔴 WHAT THIS GATE IS FOR, IN ONE SENTENCE: for the whole of phase 2 this
// module's HTTP layer, its views and fourteen other packages compiled, were
// tested, and LINKED INTO NO BINARY. `go list -deps ./cmd/...` resolved exactly
// four packages of this module — cmd/muster, cmd/muster-migrate, internal/db
// and internal/taskstatus — and internal/api appeared in none of them. A reader
// who opened routes.go, saw a RegisterRoutes that registers 99 routes, and
// concluded that a service serves them was reading correctly and concluding
// wrongly. Nothing could tell them otherwise, because "is this reachable from a
// process" is not a question any test in a package can ask about itself.
//
// 🔴 THIS GATE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AND MUST NOT BE READ AS ENOUGH. Linkage is a
// claim about the IMPORT GRAPH, and an import can be a blank `_` import that
// executes nothing. What would this test still accept? A cmd/ package that
// imports internal/api and never calls Handler; one that builds a Server and
// never listens. TestTheServerListensAndServesHealth in cmd/muster-server is
// the other half — it drives a real listener on a real port — and the two are
// only meaningful together. Deleting either leaves a hole the other does not
// cover.

// notLinkedLedger is every package of this module that is deliberately NOT
// reachable from any binary, with the reason.
//
// 🔴 IT IS AN ASSERTED LEDGER, NOT AN ALLOWLIST, AND THE TEST FAILS WHEN THE SET
// GROWS *OR* SHRINKS. A plain allowlist would silently absorb the next package
// that stops linking — which is exactly how sixteen of them accumulated. An
// entry leaving the ledger is also a failure: it means something started
// linking that was documented as unreachable, and the reason below is now a
// lie a reader would trust.

	// 🔴 internal/agentspec AND internal/provision/k8s WERE BOTH HERE, AND THEIR
	// DEPARTURE IS THE ONLY MECHANICAL SIGNAL PLAN STEP 22b HAD. Both entries said
	// so in their own text: agentspec's read "THIS ENTRY DISAPPEARING IS THE
	// SIGNAL THAT 22b LANDED … Do not wire a fake consumer to clear it", and
	// k8s's read "This entry disappearing is the signal that the seam CLOSED".
	// What removed them is cmd/muster-server/provisioner.go — it CONSTRUCTS the
	// Kubernetes driver from a real in-cluster client and hands it to
	// internal/agentprovision, which builds specs with agentspec.Build. Neither
	// arrived via a test fixture or a blank import; the deletion of these two
	// entries is what makes that a checkable claim rather than a described one.
	//
	// ⚠ THE LEDGER IS NOT WHERE THE REST OF THAT STEP IS CHECKED. Linkage says
	// "reachable from a process", nothing more. internal/agentgateway implements the
	// chat half now and links the same way — through cmd/muster-server. ⚠ THAT IS A
	// CLAIM ABOUT LINKAGE AND NOTHING ELSE, and the list of what it does not cover
	// is SHORTER now without the point changing. It read: "a chat turn against an
	// agent this binary PROVISIONED still resolves no address (agentspec declares no
	// port) and would carry a credential the container never received, and a KICKOFF
	// is undeliverable besides". The first two are fixed — agentspec declares the
	// gateway port and ships the row's token under the name the bearer is derived
	// from — and NEITHER fix was visible here, which is this gate's whole point
	// restated from the other side: the ledger stayed green through a defect that
	// made the linked code unusable, and it stays green through the change that made
	// it usable. The KICKOFF it also named ("nothing calls the gateway on the
	// dispatch path") is closed by internal/agentkickoff; what remains open is a
	// turn against an instance this binary created ON A CLUSTER, which no in-repo
	// test can make. See cmd/muster-server/doc_seams.go entry 1. TestBuildingTheKubernetesProvisionerUsesTheRealDriver,
