// Package router is muster's client for the permission router it was extracted
// from — the ONE place every outbound call to that service is spelled.
//
// 🔴 WHY A PACKAGE AND NOT A FEW http.Get CALLS AT THE SITES THAT NEED THEM.
// Before the extraction each of these was an in-process function call on a
// store this binary owned. After it they are network calls to a service with
// its own auth tier, its own failure modes and its own wire spellings, and the
// thing that goes wrong is not any single call — it is that the fifth one
// invents a second way to pass the credential, or forgets the actor header, or
// degrades a transport failure to a zero value. Consolidating them means the
// credential, the actor assertion, the timeout and the "a failed read is an
// ERROR, not a false" rule are decided once. The extraction plan's own §2.2
// records the opposite pattern — one predicate open-coded at N sites — as the
// thing it keeps finding wrong at N-1 of them.
//
// 🔴 EVERY METHOD HERE IS A SEAM THE CARVE CREATED, AND EACH ONE REPLACES AN
// IN-PROCESS CALL THAT STILL EXISTS UPSTREAM. That is the test for whether
// something belongs in this file: if muster could answer it from its own
// database, it does not go here.
//
// ⚠ TWO OF THESE CALL ROUTES muster's CREDENTIAL CANNOT CURRENTLY REACH, AND
// THAT IS RECORDED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER. See Notify and Directories; both
// carry the tier they need, the tier the route has today, and the closing
// condition. They are built because the consumer exists and the shape is
// settled; they will 401 until the upstream route is re-tiered.

//	WHY muster CANNOT SIMPLY HOLD IT: the extraction plan concludes in two
//	  separate sections that this service must not be given that tier. The
//	  token also opens task delete, task status and the comment retraction
//	  routes; handing it over to reach a notification would grant all of them.
//	WHY THE CALL IS BUILT ANYWAY: the consumer is real and already carved (the
//	  agent-ready push in internal/api), the body shape is settled, and the
//	  alternative — dropping the notification at the carve — removes a feature
//	  silently rather than visibly. It fails LOUD (ErrUnauthorized, logged by
//	  the caller) instead of quietly doing nothing.
//	CLOSING CONDITION: the router registers POST /api/notify on its service
//	  tier (the same door /api/gate and /api/sessions/{id} already use), OR
//	  this method and its one caller are deleted together and the agent-ready

//
//	WHAT: GET /api/directories exists on the router, behind a signed operator

//	  credential is not a session, so muster cannot reach it.
//	WHY THE CALL IS BUILT: the picker is muster's feature — the task-create
//	  modal is on muster's side of the route partition — and the data it wants
//	  is on the router's side. That is precisely the shape a seam exists for,
//	  and the operator decided to REBUILD the picker here rather than drop it.
//	WHAT HAPPENS MEANWHILE: the handler degrades to a seeded-only picker and
//	  SAYS SO on screen. It does not render an empty dropdown as if the archive
//	  were empty — that exact conflation is why the upstream picker shipped
//	  broken and nobody noticed for the whole of its life.
//	CLOSING CONDITION: the router registers a service-tier read of the same
