// 🔴 THIS FILE IS A SEAM GUARD, AND THE SEAM IS WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL.
//
// The subsystem-store integration is split across three surfaces that are each
// hermetically tested somewhere else: internal/agentspec builds the spec,
// internal/agentspec builds the prose, and THIS package decides which agent gets
// either. All three can be green in isolation and the combination still broken,
// because no test in either of the other two ever builds the combined state — the
// prose is an opaque input to Build, and Build is invisible to a prose test.
//
// The defect the seam admits is specific: a supervisor handed the WITH-store prose
// and a spec with no credential (or the reverse). The first tells the agent it has
// read+write access across every scope of the operator's knowledge store when it
// has none; the client then refuses locally, and the agent reports a working
// subsystem as broken. Nothing in agentspec can catch it, because agentspec is
// handed the prose already chosen.
//
// So the guards below pin RELATIONSHIPS — which agent, which prose, which spec, all
// in one assertion — plus a behavioural case, because a structural check
// type-checks past a wrong argument.

// storeSpecConfig is fixtureSpecConfig with the store configured.
//
// ⚠ THE COORDINATES ARE PAIRWISE DISTINCT AND MATCH NO CONSTANT THIS PACKAGE OR
// agentspec NAMES, so a mutant that hardcoded one cannot pass by coincidence.

// TestAHalfConfiguredStoreGatesTheProseAndTheSpecTheSameWay is the behavioural half

//
// 🔴 THE NAME SAYS WHAT THE BODY CHECKS, AND IT DID NOT USED TO. This was
// TestTheSupervisorGateIsReadOnceRatherThanComputedTwice, which claimed a
// SINGLE-READ relationship in the source. Nothing below reads the source, so the
// name was a coverage claim the body never made — and a guard that reads as covering
// something is worse than no guard, because it stops the next person looking.
//
// What it actually pins is BEHAVIOUR: across the inputs that DISCRIMINATE between
// the candidate expressions, the prose and the spec move together. The discriminating
// inputs are the half-configured ones — a URL with no token, a token with no URL,
// and each blank-but-present — for which `CairnConfigured` says false while
// `cfg.CairnURL != ""` or `cfg.CairnToken != ""` alone would say true. That is the
// hazard that matters: the prose gated by a DIFFERENT expression than the spec, so a
// supervisor is told it holds a credential the instance does not carry.
//
// ⚠ AND THE "COMPUTED TWICE" MUTANT IS NOT A HAZARD, WHICH IS WHY NO TEST HERE
// CATCHES IT. Replacing `store := a.spec.CairnConfigured()` + `ChiefInstructions(store)`
// with an inlined `ChiefInstructions(a.spec.CairnConfigured())` is the SAME
// EXPRESSION evaluated twice: it is semantically equivalent, changes no output, and
// a sweep confirmed it survives every test in these three packages. An equivalent
// mutant surviving is correct behaviour for a behavioural suite, not a gap — and the
// only way to kill it would be to grep this repository's own source text, which is a
// spelled guard on a formatting choice. Mutants that change the EXPRESSION do die
// here; those are the ones that change what an instance receives.
