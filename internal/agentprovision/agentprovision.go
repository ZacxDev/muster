// Package agentprovision adapts a [provision.Provisioner] DRIVER to the
// LIFECYCLE interface the agent HTTP handlers depend on (api.Provisioner):
// seven methods over an agent's int64 database id, rather than over a
// [provision.Ref] and a [provision.Spec].
//
// 🔴 IT IS THE LIFECYCLE HALF ONLY, AND THAT IS WHY IT CAN EXIST AT ALL. The
// consumer interface used to carry Chat and ChatWithTools as well, behind one
// nil and one wrapper, so nothing could wire provisioning without also claiming
// a model gateway this module has no implementation of. api.Provisioner and
// api.Gateway are now separate interfaces with separate nils and separate
// wrappers; this type satisfies the first and deliberately not the second, so a
// deployment gets working lifecycle routes and an honest 503 on the two chat
// ones. See internal/api/ext.go on api.Gateway.
//
// 🔴 WHAT THIS PACKAGE MUST NEVER DO, STATED BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: it must
// never call agents.Store.SetKickedOff. That column answers "was the kickoff
// message HANDED TO A READY GATEWAY" — see agents.Agent.KickedOff and
// agents.Store.SetKickedOff — and this package has no gateway, so setting it
// would be a claim about a delivery that did not happen. That is the same class
// of lie the provisioner wrappers exist to prevent (a 200 over a pod that does
// not exist), one field down. It is not left to a reader's care:
// TestTheAdapterNeverClaimsAKickoffItCannotDeliver asserts it over the whole
// method set.
//
// WHAT HAPPENS TO A PENDING KICKOFF INSTEAD: the instance is created, the note
// stays in agents.pending_note where it was written, and the non-delivery is
// RECORDED on the row via agents.Store.SetKickoffError — the field whose own doc
// calls it "evidence, not a verdict".
//
// 🔴 THAT IS NOW THE *GATEWAY-CONFIGURED* PATH ONLY, AND THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE IS
// KEPT RATHER THAN REWRITTEN BECAUSE EVERYTHING BELOW IT ARGUES FROM IT. With NO
// gateway in the process, Dispatch(kickoff=true) no longer creates anything: it
// REFUSES. See [Config.KickoffDeliverable], [ErrKickoffUndeliverable] and
// [KickoffRefusalReason].
//
// WHY THE CREATE-THEN-RECORD BEHAVIOUR WAS THE WRONG ANSWER TO "I CANNOT DELIVER
// THIS": it answered a request this configuration cannot satisfy by performing the
// expensive, credential-holding, healthy-looking HALF of it. The surface an operator
// actually drives is a Dispatch button that always appears to work; the cost per
// click is a pod with a cloned repository and a model credential that will never be
// told what to do; and the only evidence was this pod's stdout plus a machine-tier
// field, both of which the paragraphs below correctly call unread. A request that
// cannot do the thing it was asked to do should say so, not do something else.
//
// 🔴 AND THE CONDITION IS CONFIGURATION, NOT A MISSING IMPLEMENTATION.
// internal/agentgateway is shipped and live-verified; MUSTER_AGENT_GATEWAY being
// unset is the whole of why nothing can deliver. Both the refusal text and the
// constant below say so, because the earlier wording ("this build cannot deliver")
// reads as an unimplemented feature and sends its reader to write code that exists.
//
// 🔴 AND NOTHING RENDERS THAT FIELD TO A HUMAN. THIS PARAGRAPH PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED
// IT DID, AND THE CLAIM WAS MEASURED FALSE — it is recorded here rather than
// quietly corrected, because it is the most load-bearing sentence in this doc.
// It read: "rendered into the agent's error line by agents.KickoffErrorSuffix. So
// the operator sees WHY the first turn never ran rather than a card that sits in
// `provisioning` with nothing written anywhere." Three things are wrong with that:
//
//   - agents.KickoffErrorSuffix has NO caller anywhere in this module. Its only
//     references are agents/reconcile_test.go and prose; the reconcile loop that
//     would call it is explicitly OWED in reconcile.go's own header.
//   - Agent.KickoffError reaches exactly ONE surface — GET /api/agents, which is
//     hook-token-gated MACHINE tier (internal/api/machine_agents.go). No HTML view
//     carries an agent error field at all.
//   - the card does NOT "sit in provisioning". agents.ComputeStatus refines a live
//     ready instance to `running`, so the card reads HEALTHY while the first turn
//     never happened. That is worse than the state the sentence claimed to fix.
//
// So: the field is where a MACHINE or an operator with a token can read it, and
// the boot banner names it — which is honest, because the banner names a field and
// not a screen. Nothing on any page says it. Do not restate the rendering claim
// without a caller to cite.
//
// ⚠ THAT IS A RECORD, NOT A FIX, AND THE GAP IT RECORDS HAS TWO OWNERS. The
// delivery itself needs a gateway (plan step 22c); the ESCALATION of an
// undelivered kickoff to a red card already exists as a pure decision table in
// agents.DecideReconcile (ActionRetryKickoff, then ActionError past
// ProvisioningStuckTimeout) and needs the reconcile loop that table's own header
// declares OWED. Neither is in this package's scope and neither is silently
// assumed: until they land, a dispatch with kickoff=true produces an instance that
// reads HEALTHY on every page and was never told what to do.

// the agent what to do — cannot happen at all.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A SENTINEL SO A CALLER CAN TELL IT FROM A DRIVER ERROR. Nothing in this
// module matches on it yet: the only consumer of Dispatch's error is a background
// goroutine in internal/api that logs it (see [KickoffRefusalReason]'s own note on

// FROM [UndeliveredKickoffReason]. That constant is evidence about a thing that
// already happened and its reader can do nothing with it; this one is read by
// someone whose click was just refused, so it has to answer "why" and "what do I
// set". An error with no remedy is how an operator concludes the feature is broken
// and files a bug against the agent.
//
// 🔴 IT SAYS THE CAPABILITY EXISTS, ON PURPOSE. internal/agentgateway is shipped
// and live-verified; what makes THIS refusal fire is that MUSTER_AGENT_GATEWAY is
// unset, so it resolves to `none` and cmd/muster-server/provisioner.go's
// buildGateway returns nil. A message that read "this build cannot deliver a
// kickoff" — which is how the pre-refusal log line was phrased — sends the reader to
// write code that is already written.
//
// 🔴 BUT SETTING THE VARIABLE IS NOT THE WHOLE FIX, AND THE TEXT MUST NOT IMPLY IT
// IS. An earlier revision of this constant ended "...and dispatch again", which
// promises a delivery the next dispatch does not make: doc_seams.go entry 1 records
// that NOTHING CALLS THE GATEWAY ON THE DISPATCH PATH, plus two blockers ahead of
// that call site (agentspec.Build renders no port, so the driver resolves no
// address; and the bearer is derived from a variable name the provisioned container
// does not receive). So the honest claim is narrow: setting the variable lifts THIS
// refusal and returns the deployment to create-then-record. Promising more would
// walk the operator from a refusal they can act on into the stranded-note behaviour
// this refusal exists to prevent — and they would have no reason to look further.
// Guarded by TestTheRemedyDoesNotPromiseADeliveryTheDispatchPathCannotMake.
//
// ⚠ THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE IS SPELLED AS A LITERAL HERE AND THE BINARY HAS ITS
// OWN CONSTANT FOR IT. This package cannot import package main, so the two
// spellings are genuinely duplicated, and a duplicated name is a name that goes
// stale in one place. That is not left to care:
// TestTheKickoffRefusalNamesTheBinarysOwnGatewayVariable in cmd/muster-server
// asserts this string contains envAgentGateway, so renaming the variable there
// reddens here.
//
// ⚠ WHERE AN OPERATOR ACTUALLY READS IT, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: the boot
// banner, this pod's log, the agent row's status becoming `error` (which
// agents.ComputeStatus treats as terminal, so the card can no longer be refined to
// `running` by a live instance that does not exist), and agents.error_message on
// the hook-token-gated GET /api/agents. 🔴 IT DOES *NOT* REACH THE HTTP RESPONSE OF
// THE POST THAT ASKED, AND THAT IS THE HALF THIS PACKAGE CANNOT CLOSE:
// internal/api's createAndDispatchAgent calls Dispatch inside safeGo, so the
// returned error is logged and the operator's POST has already answered 200. The
// row's `error` status is the strongest signal reachable from here. Closing the
// rest is a synchronous check in internal/api's create handler, BEFORE the row is

// Dispatch provisions an instance for the agent when kickoff is true, and

//
// 🔴 kickoff=false CREATES NO INSTANCE, AND AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS METHOD
// CREATED ONE. That revision mirrored the upstream implementation, which installs
// its release either way and then stores `stopped` — and carrying that across
// turned a consumer-side comment into a falsehood and bypassed a guard. The caller
// is internal/api's createAndDispatchAgent, where `kickoff` is
// `action == "dispatch"`: the OTHER action is the UI's "Save for later" button,
// and the gate check four lines above it refuses a dispatch of a
// `gate:<reason>`-tagged task while allowing a save, giving as its reason that a
// save "provisions nothing". That was TRUE for as long as this module had no
// provisioner at all. Wiring one made it false in the worst direction: a save on a
// task explicitly gated from being worked created a pod, cloned the repository into
// it, and handed it a model credential — one per click, with the gate's own check
// passing.
//
// So the two arguments now differ in WHAT IS BUILT, not only in what is stored:
//
//	kickoff=true  -> WITH a gateway in the process (Config.KickoffDeliverable):
//	                 create the instance, store `provisioning` (a first turn is
//	                 owed), and record the non-delivery. See the package doc.
//	                 WITHOUT one: REFUSE — create nothing, store `error` carrying
//	                 KickoffRefusalReason, and return ErrKickoffUndeliverable.
//	kickoff=false -> create nothing, store `stopped`. The status is now TRUE
//	                 rather than a statement about what this service is waiting
//	                 for, which is also what makes the model-change roll in
//	                 internal/api correct for such an agent: it branches on the
//	                 STORED status, so a `stopped` row over a running instance

		//   - internal/ui renders that status as a coloured DOT with a title
		//     attribute (statusIcon / cardStatusIcon / liveStatusIcon). The colour
		//     changes; no text does.
		//
		// WHAT THE DEAD DRAFTS CLAIMED, so nobody re-derives them:
		//   1. "a red card NAMING an ownership refusal" — Agent.ErrorMessage reaches
		//      no HTML surface at all.
		//   2. "a red PILL" — ui.statusDot IS a labelled pill and has ZERO callers
		//      tree-wide. It is not what renders. The CARD's border is unconditional.
		//   3. "reaches exactly ONE surface, the hook-token-gated GET /api/agents" —
		//      newAgentJSON is also called from the task API (internal/api/notes.go),
		//      and requireHookToken is ENFORCE-WHEN-SET, so on a server with no
		//      MUSTER_HOOK_TOKEN it is gated by nothing.
		//
		// So the operator gets a dot that turns red instead of a card that silently
		// reappears, and the REASON is machine-readable only. That is worth having and
		// it is all that is claimed.

// 🔴 agentspec.WorkerInstructions IS PASSED, NOT OMITTED. That prose is the only

// TestTheInstructionsAndTheDaemonReferToEachOther), so an adapter that built a
// spec without it would ship the daemon and tell nobody to look at its log —
// which is what that test's "move both or neither" is about, one layer up.
//
// 🔴 THE SUPERVISOR IS THE ONE AGENT THAT GETS DIFFERENT PROSE AND THE ONE AGENT
// ELIGIBLE FOR THE SUBSYSTEM-STORE CREDENTIAL, AND THAT POLICY LIVES HERE BY
// DESIGN. agentspec deliberately does not compare an agent name against a
// constant — its own Options.SeedFiles comment argues that a name-to-privilege
// rule is a caller's policy, not a spec-building rule — so this is the layer that
// knows which row is the supervisor. The credential is READ+WRITE across every
// scope of the operator's knowledge store; a dispatched worker running a model
// over somebody's repository contents has no business holding one, and widening
// the condition below is a one-line change here while un-polluting the store is
// not. See internal/agentspec/cairn.go.
//
// 🔴 BOTH CONSUMERS GO THROUGH THE SAME PREDICATE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. The
// PROSE claims the credential and the SPEC carries it, and those two must not be
// able to disagree — a supervisor told it holds a read+write key it does not have
// reports a working subsystem as broken. What makes that impossible is that both
// answers come from [agentspec.Config.CairnConfigured]: this function passes it to
// ChiefInstructions, and agentspec's own gate calls the same method when it decides
// whether to place the client and the credential. The hazard is a SECOND
// EXPRESSION — `cfg.CairnURL != ""` in one place and the method in the other, which
// disagree for every half-configured input. Two guards pin it, both behavioural:
// TestTheSupervisorsProseAndItsSpecAgreeAboutTheStore on the configured and
// unconfigured cases, and the half-configured one on the inputs that DISCRIMINATE
// between the candidate expressions.
//
// ⚠ THIS USED TO CLAIM THE GATE IS "READ ONCE INTO A VARIABLE AND USED TWICE", AND
// THAT INVARIANT DOES NOT EXIST. The variable below is read ONCE; the second
// consumer never sees it, because agentspec re-evaluates the predicate itself
// inside its own gate. So the single-read form buys nothing, the inlined form is
