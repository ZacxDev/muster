// TestDispatchWithoutAKickoffCreatesNothing is the guard for the defect this
// package's Dispatch doc is about, and it is the one the suite most conspicuously
// lacked: the behaviour changed from "creates a 1-replica instance" to "creates
// nothing" and the ENTIRE existing suite stayed green, in both directions.
//
// 🔴 WHAT IT PROTECTS IS A GUARD IN ANOTHER PACKAGE. internal/api's dispatch
// handler refuses a `gate:<reason>`-tagged task only when `action == "dispatch"`,
// and its comment gives the reason: "save for later" is still allowed because it
// "provisions nothing". `kickoff` IS `action == "dispatch"`, so an adapter that
// creates on kickoff=false makes that sentence false and walks straight through the
// gate — one pod per click, with the repository cloned into it and a model
// credential in a Secret, for a task explicitly marked not-ready-to-work.
//
// ⚠ A STATUS-ONLY ASSERTION WOULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT IT. `stopped` was written on
// both the old and the new behaviour; only the driver's own state distinguishes
// them, which is why this asserts the CREATE COUNT and the backend's instance list
// rather than the row.

// ⚠ THIS IS AN ORDER ASSERTION, WHICH THE OLD FAKE COULD NOT EXPRESS. The store

// ⚠ "EVERY METHOD" MEANS EVERY METHOD THAT HAS BOTH HALVES TO ORDER — three of them.
// The name overstated it, so here is the account, over all EIGHT methods on the

// paragraph called itself exhaustive over the seven without saying so, and omitted the
// eighth — which is the one with a real store write:
//
//   - Dispatch(kickoff=true), Start, Stop — the three rows below.
//   - Destroy — covered by TestATimedOutDestroyStillDELETESTheRow and
//     TestDestroyRecordsWHYItKeptTheRow instead.
//   - Dispatch(kickoff=false) — makes NO driver call, so this test's own `di < 0`
//     positive control would fire. Its guard is
//     TestDispatchWithoutAKickoffCreatesNothing.
//   - Instances, TailLogs, StreamLogs — touch no store, so there is no order.
//   - ReapplyProfiles — DOES write before its driver call (ensureHooksToken, then
//     driver.Update), but writes no STATUS, so the `si < 0` control would fire. Its
//     guard is TestReapplyProfilesMintsAMissingToken. ⚠ The write-then-Update order
//     there has a recorded consequence rather than an asserted one: see
//     ensureHooksToken's own note — a failed Update leaves the row holding a token the
