// dropped (the full rendered markdown takes over), the navigation link and the
// chevron are gone, and the full body — markdown, attachments, session thread,
// comments and the add-comment form — renders unconditionally.
//

// POST/DELETE, tag add/remove, edit) re-renders through internal/api's
// renderNoteCard, which derives Detail from the request's own HX-Current-URL.

// taskSessionRow implemented two. See there for what each one now renders.
//
// The first distinction is the one migration 0023 is built around: a session whose
// cc_sessions row has been swept still renders a ROW, because "this task was worked
// by a session whose transcript is gone" and "this task was never worked" are
// completely different facts about the task. The link row is self-sufficient —
// role, project, cwd and both timestamps are stored on it — so a transcript-less
// row is still informative.
//
// The block is its own nested <details> so there is a real, session-specific
// expand control to attach the telemetry to (a cgTrack on the CARD's summary
// would fire for every expand, measuring nothing about this feature), and so the
// thread can still be folded away on a task with a long one.
//
// 🔴 IT RENDERS `open`, AND THAT IS NOT COSMETIC — a COLLAPSED <details> is what
// generated a false "the Open session chip is painted but unclickable" bug report
// (muster task 486). This used to say the collapse existed "so the thread does
// not lengthen every EXPANDED CARD by N rows". That reason died with #654: the
// section is rendered only under `g.If(v.Detail, …)`, so there is exactly ONE
// card on the page and nothing for it to lengthen. The rationale outlived the
// board-card layout it was written for (#357).
//
// The reporting trap is worth stating once, because it will recur on any of this
// page's other disclosures: Chromium gives a closed <details>'s content
// `content-visibility: hidden`, under which a descendant STILL reports a
// plausible non-zero getBoundingClientRect(), a single getClientRects() entry, a
// non-null offsetParent, and `pointerEvents: auto` / `visibility: visible` /
// `opacity: 1` — the exact three properties a prober reaches for to conclude "not
// hidden, just covered". Only `el.checkVisibility()` (false vs true, measured on

// DirectorySearchPath is the route the directory combobox searches against. It

// with no error anywhere, which is the failure mode this whole component exists
// to stop happening twice.
const DirectorySearchPath = "/api/directories"

// directoryCombobox renders the task directory picker.
//
// 🔴 IT IS A SEED PLUS A SERVER-SIDE SEARCH, NOT A DUMP. This used to be a
// <datalist> holding EVERY known directory as an <option>. The live archive
// holds 1,532 of them totalling 114,122 characters of path text, so at 26 bytes
// of markup per <option> that shape is ~154 KB shipped into the DOM on every
// single modal open — and the picker was empty anyway, because the query behind
// it read a table that is empty by design (see notes.PGStore.Directories).
// Repointing the query without changing the shape would have turned an invisible
// bug into a 154 KB one.
//
// The shape instead:
//
//   - `seed` — notes.DefaultDirectoryLimit most-recently-used directories,
//     rendered INLINE as data-combobox-seed options. They are in the markup
//     before any network call, so the picker is never empty while a request is
//     in flight, and they cost 6,789 bytes rather than ~154 KB (measured by
//     TestDirectoryPickerPayloadStaysSmall, which also logs both numbers).
//   - EVERYTHING ELSE — reached by typing. The combobox's remote mode
//     (data-combobox-remote, internal/ui/components.go) fires a 200 ms-debounced,
//     per-query-cached GET to DirectorySearchPath?q=…, which substring-matches
//     the WHOLE archive server-side and answers at most
//     notes.MaxDirectoryResults paths as a JSON array — ~1.9 KB. So no single
//     interaction is large, and no directory is unreachable.
//   - ANYTHING AT ALL — typed free text. This is VALUE MODE: there is no
//     data-combobox-hidden sibling, so the visible input IS the submitted
//     `directory` field (cbPick writes the picked path into it). A path that has
//     never appeared in a permission request still submits exactly as typed,
//     which is the property the old <input list=…> had and must not lose.
//
// `failed` is the read's error state travelling WITH the field — see the
// directoryPickerFailed notice for why silence was not an option.

// directoryPickerFailed renders the warning-coloured one-liner shown when the directory

//
// 🔴 THIS IS THE SIGNAL THAT WAS MISSING, AND THE REASON IS WORTH READING.
// Both call sites used to do `dirs = nil // non-fatal: the picker is just empty`
// and log. That is two distinct facts collapsed into one observable: "you have
// no directory history" and "the read broke" both render as an empty picker,
// and an operator cannot tell them apart. The log line was there the whole time
// and nobody read it — logs are where a UI defect goes to be invisible.
//
// So the state travels with the field and says which one it is. This is the same
// discipline chiefThreadRows already applies to the thread list ("Could not
// search threads just now — this is not an empty result"), and it deliberately
// does NOT block anything: the input above stays editable and the form still
// submits, because a missing suggestion list must never stop someone filing a
// task.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS HONEST ABOUT WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER. The bug this component was
// built for produced NO ERROR — the old query succeeded and returned zero rows —
// so this notice would never have fired for it, and nothing rendered at runtime
// could have. That case is covered by a TEST instead
// (notes.TestDirectoriesReadsRequestHistory), which seeds request_history with
// `requests` left empty and demands a non-empty answer. Do not read this notice
// as a guard against the empty-picker class generally; it guards the half a
