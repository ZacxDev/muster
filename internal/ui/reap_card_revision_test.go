// TestAReapedTaskCardKeepsItsRevision is a SEAM test, and it is here rather than
// in internal/notes or internal/api because neither of those can make the claim.
//
// The two halves are each already covered in isolation — internal/notes proves
// FlagIdle leaves `updated_at` alone, internal/ui proves noteCard renders
// `updated_at` as data-card-rev — and "verified in isolation" is exactly the shape
// that ships a broken seam. What no component test builds is the COMBINED state:
// a real Postgres row, actually reaped, actually rendered. That is what this does.
//
// 🔴 WHY THE REVISION MUST NOT MOVE, stated as the relationship rather than as
// two facts. data-card-rev is the card's version, and resyncScript refuses a
// morph:outerHTML whose incoming rev is STRICTLY OLDER than the one on screen.
// internal/ui/notes.go's own argument for that guard is that "a write that
// legitimately does not move updated_at ... is never dropped, because ties always
// apply". The reaper's annotation is now precisely such a write, so this test is
// what turns that sentence from an assertion about a hypothetical into one about
// a real writer. If it ever fails, either FlagIdle started writing updated_at or
// the guard stopped applying ties, and BOTH are regressions.
//
// PG-gated: the property under test is a property of the SQL. A fake would only
// restate what the fake was written to do.
