// presentation_defects_test.go — regression guards for a batch of UI defects
// measured on the running board, one guard per defect.
//
// 🔴 EVERY ONE OF THESE ASSERTS RENDERED STATE, NOT A WORD THE SOURCE HAPPENS TO
// CONTAIN. The chip guard compares the chip SET against the status enum rather
// than four literal strings; the markdown guards look for `<hr>` and for an
// `href` attribute rather than for the absence of `---` or the presence of
// "http"; the contrast guard COMPUTES a ratio from the palette rather than
// naming a class. A guard another feature can spell its way past is not a guard.
//
// ⚠ WHAT NO TEST HERE CAN SEE. This repository has no browser suite, so nothing
// below renders at a VIEWPORT — these assert the markup and the class ladder the
// browser would then lay out. For the two defects that are layout (the chat
// column width, the contrast ratio) the guards therefore pin the INPUTS to the
// layout — which element carries the width cap, which palette entry the label
// uses — and the measured pixel/ratio figures that motivated them live in the
// comments at the code, where they were taken. Say that rather than let a green
// tick imply a rendering was checked.

// --- Defect 1: the agent chat column -----------------------------------------

// TestTheSidebarOffsetAndTheWidthCapAreNeverOnOneElement is the regression guard
// for a chat column that measured 272px wide on a 2256px screen.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE BUG, which is what this asserts: `max-w-*` caps the BORDER
// box, and `lg:pl-72` (18rem = 288px) is padding INSIDE that box. Put both on one
// element with max-w-xl (576px) and the content area is 288px before anything
// else happens — narrower than a phone, with ~800px of dead space either side.
// The shell always had the right shape (offset on an outer column, width on the
// element inside it); /agents/{name} was the odd one out.
//
// It sweeps EVERY class attribute of EVERY document rather than the one element
// that was wrong, because the next instance of this will be a different element.
