// the whole suite: with a badge in BOTH places, the single-node lookup found the

// endpoint writes ui.RenderStatusIcon — the bare dot, nothing else. A badge nested
// inside it renders correctly on first paint, passes every assertion above, and
// then vanishes on the first poll tick, which is indistinguishable from "the
// kickoff was delivered". Only a structural check can see this; the markup is
// identical either way at render time.

// inside cardStatusIcon's Span while leaving the sibling in place produced TWO
// badges; the old single-node lookup found the sibling, walked its safe ancestry
// and passed, with a doomed copy in the swap target. Re-measured after the fix:
// the ADDITIVE mutant now dies on the duplicate count, and the MOVE mutant (the
// sibling deleted, the badge inside the span) dies on this test's own hx-swap
// message. Both are recorded because the second is the realistic edit and the
