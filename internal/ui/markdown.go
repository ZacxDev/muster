// markdown.go — a small, dependency-free, escape-FIRST markdown renderer used to
// format machine+user-authored task bodies (and comments) on the server.
//
// Safety: the source is HTML-escaped BEFORE any markup is applied, so no author
// content can ever inject HTML/JS — the only tags in the output are the ones we
// emit. This mirrors the client-side mdRender in agents_detail.go (escape →
// inline → block) so the two renderers behave the same; we keep a Go copy rather
// than pulling a markdown library (blackfriday is only an indirect dep) to keep
// the surface tiny and the escaping guarantee auditable.
//
// Supported: bold (**x**), italic (*x* / _x_), inline code (`x`), fenced code
// blocks (```lang … ```), blockquotes (> …), bullet lists (- / *), ordered
// lists (1.), ATX headings (# … ######), thematic breaks (--- / *** / ___),
// bare-URL autolinks, GFM pipe tables, and paragraphs.
// Anything else degrades to escaped paragraph text — never to raw HTML.
