// 🔴 THIS DOCUMENT DELIBERATELY STAMPS NOTHING ON ITS REQUESTS.
//
// It used to carry `hx-headers='{"X-Muster-View":"detail"}'` on <body>, and
// internal/api's renderNoteCard branched on that header to pick the card shape.
// The seam leaked: htmx boosts with target=document.body and swap=innerHTML, and
// an innerHTML swap replaces a node's CHILDREN, never its ATTRIBUTES — so any
// boosted navigation off this page (the eight sidebar tabs, boosted by design)
// left the stamp on the live <body> of the BOARD, and every subsequent board
// mutation came back as a DETAIL card morphed into #tasks-list.
//
// The shape is now derived from htmx's own HX-Current-URL, per request, in
// internal/api/view.go — which carries the full account. Two tests hold the
// markup half here: TestNoDocumentsBodyCarriesAnythingABoostedNavCanStrand
// (the <body> attribute ledger) and
// TestDetailPageAttachesNoInheritedRequestStampAnywhere (the same hazard moved
// onto any other ancestor of the card).

// TaskDetailPage renders the standalone GET /tasks/{id} document: the task's
// full body, attachments, session thread, comments and comment form, wrapped in
// the app's shared chrome.
//
// It is an OFF-SHELL document (its own Doctype/HTML/Head/Body), like
// AgentDetailPage and sessionDetailPage — the shell's Page() is not reused,
// because the shell is the multi-panel SPA and this page has no panels.
//
// 🔴 hasPanels=false on the sidebar. With no #panel-* elements in this document
// the sidebar tabs must stay BOOSTED — there is nothing to toggle in place, so
// a boosted cross-document navigation IS the behaviour. TestSidebarTabBoostIs
// OwnedByThePanelOwner checks that against the panels actually rendered.
//
// 🔴 /tasks/{id} is deliberately NOT in tabFromPath. That switch is exact-match
// and only feeds handleIndex, which never serves this document — same as
// /agents/{name} and /suggestions/{id}, neither of which is in it either.

//   - hx-request {"timeout":15000} — INHERITED by every request-issuing
//     descendant (htmx resolves hx-request by walking up parentElement and does
//     not honour hx-disinherit), so the status PATCH, the comment POST, the
//     delete and the dispatch/edit GETs are all BOUNDED here exactly as they are
//     on the board. resyncScript's htmx:timeout listener is what makes that
//     bound visible instead of silent.
//   - a re-fetch on sse:task.changed / sse:agent.changed, so a comment posted by
//     an agent, a status flipped from another device or a linked agent going
//     `running` lands on this page without a reload.
//   - a re-fetch on muster:resync, which resyncScript dispatches on focus,
//     visibility regain and SSE reconnect — the case SSE alone misses, because a
//     backgrounded connection can drop and miss events while hidden.
