// 🔴 IT TAKES ONLY THE ACTIVE TAB. Upstream's shell also took the pending
// permission-request list plus two auto-approve snapshots, and rendered the
// request queue server-side into the first paint. None of those exist in
// muster: the permission-routing surface, the request store and the
// auto-approve window machinery all stay with the router. Every tabpanel here
// is lazy — it fetches its own partial on `load` — so there is nothing for the
// first paint to embed.
// tab is one entry in muster's navigation: the key (which is also the path
// segment and the tabpanel id suffix), the sidebar label, the sidebar glyph and
// the document <h1> text.
//
// 🔴 ONE REGISTRY, NOT FOUR PARALLEL LISTS. Upstream spelled the tab set FOUR
// times — a `tabKeys` slice, a `tabHeadings` map, a hand-written run of
// sidebarTab(...) calls, and a `TABS` array inside the browser script — and its
// own comment records what that cost: a tab added to the slice but not the map
// rendered a generic <h1> and left the PREVIOUS tab's heading in place on an SPA
// switch, silently, because a tab missing from BOTH lists leaves the two in
// perfect agreement and a comparison between them sees nothing.
//
// muster derives all four from this one slice, so the failure has nowhere to
// live: the sidebar is g.Map'd over it, the headings map is built from it, and
// appScript emits the JS arrays from it. TestNavigationIsDerivedFromOneRegistry
// pins that derivation — it is a relationship guard, not a spelling guard, so
// renaming a tab cannot satisfy it while leaving a consumer behind.

// and layout all stay with the permission router. Carrying them across would

// ⚠ SEAM — `runbooks` AND `privileges` HAVE NO DOCUMENT ROUTE YET, AND THAT IS
// RECORDED HERE RATHER THAN HIDDEN BY DROPPING THEM.
//
//	WHAT: this shell links to /runbooks and /privileges, and it renders a
//	  tabpanel for each that lazy-loads /ui/runbooks and /ui/privileges. The two
//	  PARTIAL routes exist in the route partition manifest on muster's side; the
//	  two DOCUMENT routes do not exist anywhere, upstream or here, because
//	  upstream reaches both surfaces from inside other views rather than from its
//	  nav.
//	WHY NOT JUST DROP THEM: muster owns the runbook and privilege views outright
//	  (internal/runbooks, internal/privilege and the renderers in this package).
//	  A navigation that cannot reach a view muster serves makes the service
//	  usable only by something that already knows its URLs — an API with a
//	  decorative shell, not a standalone product.
//	CLOSING CONDITION: the API carve registers `GET /runbooks` and
//	  `GET /privileges` as shell routes on muster's side (the same shape as
//	  `GET /tasks`, `GET /agents` and `GET /repos`, which route to the index
//	  handler with the tab derived from the path), and both appear in muster's
//	  regenerated routes.golden. If that carve instead decides these two surfaces
//	  are not top-level, the remedy is to delete their entries from this slice —
//	  which deletes the links, the panels and the headings together, because they
//	  are all derived from it.

// panelClass returns the tabpanel class string, hidden unless active — and, for
// a panel whose own contents are DESTRUCTIVELY REPLACED, makes it INELIGIBLE AS
// A SCROLL ANCHOR.
//
// 🔴 `[overflow-anchor:none]` IS THE FIX FOR "ON MOBILE IT PERIODICALLY SCROLLS
// THE PAGE BY ITSELF". On the app shell the SCROLL CONTAINER IS THE DOCUMENT
// (`<body class="min-h-dvh …">`), and htmx's innerHTML swap inserts the new
// children and then removes the old ones — so the node the browser had chosen as
// its scroll anchor is destroyed mid-swap, and the browser's scroll-anchoring
// machinery then MOVES the document's scroll offset, unasked, to keep its
// (degraded) anchor where it was. No script is involved: nothing calls
// `scrollTo`, nothing assigns `scrollTop`, nothing calls `scrollIntoView` or
// `focus()`, and the document height does not change. That is what identifies
// the mechanism — a script-driven jump would show up in a call stack, and a
// height change would explain it without anchoring.
//
// 🔴 THE MECHANISM IS INHERITED; THE PANEL TABLE IS NOT. This behaviour was
// measured upstream, in a mobile browser at 390x844, against a panel set muster
// does not have — the numbers were taken on that project's permission-request,
// tmux and layout panels, none of which exist here, and re-quoting them as if
// they described muster's panels would be a claim about a measurement nobody
// took on this tree. What carries across is the CAUSE (a destructive swap
// destroys the anchor) and the REMEDY (exclude that subtree); what does not
// carry across is any particular scroll offset.
//
// 🔴 THE SECOND PARAMETER IS SET FROM WHAT THE PANEL CONTAINS, NOT FROM HOW THE
// PANEL ITSELF IS SWAPPED. `destructiveSwap` is true when ANY swap wired inside
// the panel discards nodes that are inside it — the panel's own
// `hx-target=#itself` + `innerHTML`, OR a descendant's plain
// `innerHTML`/`outerHTML` onto something the panel contains. Upstream's version
// of this table answered `no` for two panels by reasoning about how their bodies
// ARRIVED ("morph, so the panel survives") rather than what those bodies
// CONTAINED, and both answers were wrong: a per-card status icon polling itself
// on a timer discards nodes inside its panel every ten seconds with nobody
// touching the page.
//
// Read off muster's rendered subtrees, ALL FIVE PANELS ANSWER `true`:
//
//	#panel-tasks       morph at the panel level, BUT the delete confirm is
//	                   `outerHTML swap:200ms` onto `#task-<id>`, inside it
//	#panel-agents      morph at the panel level, BUT the card status icon
//	                   (self, innerHTML, on a timer), the recent slot, and the
//	                   rename/delete confirms (`#agent-<id>`, outerHTML) all
//	                   discard nodes inside it
//	#panel-repos       the panel is its own target, innerHTML
//	#panel-runbooks    the panel is its own target, innerHTML
//	#panel-privileges  the panel is its own target, innerHTML
//
// ⚠ SO THE `false` BRANCH IS UNEXERCISED IN muster TODAY, AND THAT IS STATED
// RATHER THAN HIDDEN BY DELETING THE PARAMETER. Upstream had exactly one
// non-destructive panel and measured a real benefit from leaving it eligible —
// content that grows ABOVE the viewport is precisely the case anchoring exists
// for. muster has no such panel yet; the knob stays because the predicate is
// then stated in ONE place for whatever panel arrives next, rather than being
// re-derived at a new call site by someone reasoning about morph semantics the
// way upstream did when it got this wrong twice.
// TestEveryTabpanelDeclaresItsSwapHonestly derives the expected value from each
// rendered subtree, so a call site that answers wrong fails in either direction.
//
// ⚠ THE `hidden` BRANCH CARRIES THE OPT-OUT TOO, and that is load-bearing rather
// than symmetry: appScript's `show()` switches tabs CLIENT-SIDE
// (`p.classList.toggle('hidden', t !== tab)`), so a panel that was server-rendered
// hidden becomes the showing one with NO re-render. Whatever the hidden branch
// returned is the class list it swaps under.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT COSTS, SAID OUT LOUD — AND IT IS THE WHOLE PAGE, NOT JUST THE PANEL.
// Once the operator has scrolled INTO a panel, nothing at or below the scroll
// position is an eligible anchor: the only other in-flow content (the sr-only
// `<h1>` and `#push-status`) sits ABOVE the panels, the header is `sticky`, and
// the sidebar / FABs / modals / chief panel are `fixed`. So anchoring is
// effectively off for the document on every muster tab. That is the intended
// trade rather than an accident — but it IS scroller-level behaviour, so do not
// read this as "only the panel is affected". The one reachable loss today is
// pwaScript un-`hidden`ing `#push-status`, a one-line bar in the content column
// above the panels and therefore uncompensated.

// The ladder, and why it stops where it does:
//
//	base            ≤1023px   max-w-xl       (36rem / 576px) — phone + tablet
//	lg              ≥1024px   max-w-5xl      (64rem / 1024px) — old desktop measure
//	xl              ≥1280px   max-w-6xl      (72rem / 1152px)
//	2xl             ≥1536px   max-w-[110rem] (1760px)
//	min-[2560px]    ≥2560px   max-w-[150rem] (2400px) — the ultrawide step
//
// 🔴 THE OLD CAP WAS A DELIBERATE DECISION AND IT HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY REVERSED
// (operator, 2026-09-06). It read: "ultrawide is a deliberate cap, not an
// oversight … past 1536px the right answer is more COLUMNS, not longer lines."
// The reasoning was sound and the conclusion was wrong for this app, because the
// dominant content on a wide monitor is not prose — it is tmux pane text, which
// is monospace, pre-wrapped, and gets strictly more readable with width. 1920 and
// 3440 previously shared the last bucket, so an ultrawide monitor showed the same
// 1536px column as a laptop and the rest of the glass went to background.
//
// 🔴 WHAT KEEPS THE OLD ARGUMENT SATISFIED IS proseWidth(), NOT THE CAP. The
// container is now wide; PROSE inside it is capped near 70ch at its own element
// (see proseWidth). That is the split the old comment could not make from the
// shell alone: grids, tables and monospace take the full column, sentences do
// not. Removing proseWidth without restoring a shell cap re-creates exactly the
// 3400px line length the previous decision was protecting against.
//
// ⚠ 2560px is a real device boundary, not a round number: it is the width at
// which a 1440p/ultrawide panel stops being "a big desktop". Tailwind's default
// scale ends at 2xl, so the last step is an arbitrary `min-[2560px]:` variant.
//

//     fallback once it reconciles; that is inherited behaviour this split
//     deliberately leaves alone — styling promises nothing, which is exactly

//   - currentTab drives aria-current="page", which asserts *this link points at
//     the document you are reading*. It must be EMPTY ("") whenever no sidebar
//     link points at this document, because a false aria-current is a stronger
//     lie than no styling: a screen reader announces the wrong link as the
//     current page.
//
// The two coincide on the shell (each tab has a real URL) and on agent-detail
// (the Agents link is the section index, which is near-universal practice), and
// they DIVERGE on /operator: nothing in the sidebar routes to /operator, so it
// passes currentTab="" and renders no aria-current at all. Before this was
// explicit, /operator painted aria-current on Agents server-side and appScript

//
// 🔴 hasPanels (the home shell) renders hx-boost="false", and that is
// load-bearing, not an optimisation. appScript's handler calls
// e.preventDefault() to keep the click in-page, but htmx 2.0.4's boosted-anchor
// listener does NOT consult event.defaultPrevented — it is a listener on the
// SAME anchor, so preventDefault cannot reach it. On the shell every tab click
// therefore produced TWO history entries: ours (switchTab's pushState,
// synchronous) and htmx's (replaceState + pushState once the boosted GET
// returns, ASYNCHRONOUS). Browser Back then spent a press on the duplicate and
// appeared to do nothing. Measured directly by instrumenting history:
// load '/' → click Tasks → click Repos left the stack as
// ['/', '/tasks', '/tasks', '/repos', '/repos'] (history.length 2 → 6).
// Because htmx's second push lands off a network response, whether Back moved
// depended on timing — which is what made routing.spec's back/forward test flaky
// (5 failed / 5 passed at --repeat-each=10 --retries=0). Opting the shell's tabs
// OUT of boost gives the JS router sole ownership: exactly one entry per tab
// click, and no redundant full-page GET per click either. Off-shell
// (agent-detail / operator) the tabs stay boosted — there is no panel to toggle,
// so the boosted navigation IS the behaviour. Pinned by
// TestSidebarTabBoostIsOwnedByThePanelOwner.
//
// Accepted consequence: because the shell's tab navigations no longer go
// through htmx, their URLs are not in htmx's history cache, so a Back that
// lands on one after a boosted nav REFETCHES instead of restoring a snapshot.

// deep-linked tab correctly and only an in-page switch onto it misbehaves —
// `TABS.indexOf(tab)` returns -1 so the swipe gesture skips it, and
// `HEADINGS[tab]` is undefined so the <h1> keeps announcing the PREVIOUS tab's
// subject. Deriving both from musterTabs makes the disagreement impossible
// rather than detectable.
//
// ⚠ json.Marshal, NOT string concatenation. A label containing an apostrophe
// ("Today's runs") pasted into a single-quoted JS literal ends the string and
// produces a syntax error that kills the WHOLE script — sidebar, tab routing,
// toasts and FABs — with nothing on screen to say why.
// 🔴 IT EMITS THE VISIBLE TABS, NOT THE WHOLE REGISTRY, AND THE THREE VALUES
// MUST AGREE WITH WHAT WAS DRAWN. A tab in TABS whose panel this document did
// not render is a tab the swipe gesture can select and switchTab can restore
// from localStorage, landing the operator on a document with every panel hidden;
// and PANEL_SELECTOR is used to find the panels that exist, so naming a missing
// one there makes every query it feeds shorter by an element that was never
// there. Deriving all three from visibleTabs is what keeps the browser's model
// of the shell equal to the shell.

  // length — or, if the list shrank, at the clamp. Twelve hours keeps the case the

  // offset a restore is trying to reach and has NOT reached; 0 means none.
  //
  // Cold start with a stored 900: at t=100ms the panels have not filled, so the
  // scroll is clamped far below it. Background the app there and an unguarded
  // navSaveScroll writes that clamp; navReadScroll rejects 0 outright, and a
  // partial clamp is worse still — it persists 120 instead of 900, permanently,
  // and looks like a working restore.
  //
  // 🔴 IT IS KEYED ON THE TARGET, NOT ON A DEADLINE, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS A
  // FIX. A time-based version narrowed the window to 2s instead of closing it:
  // a restore ABANDONED short of its target leaves the viewport on the clamp,
  // and the NEXT teardown — after the deadline has passed — persists that clamp.
  // The corrupting state is "the restore never got there", which outlives any
  // deadline.
  //
  // 🔴 navApplyScroll HAS FOUR OUTCOMES AND ONLY TWO OF THEM RELEASE THE TARGET.
  // Two earlier versions of this heading miscounted — "exactly two things", which
  // omitted the most ORDINARY outcome, and then "THREE EXITS AND ONLY ONE
  // RELEASES", which contradicted its own list three lines later. The list is the
  // authority; count it:
  //   LANDED            -> release. The screen now shows the stored position.
  //   OPERATOR INPUT    -> release. The position on screen is theirs.
  //   BUDGET EXPIRED    -> KEEP. The restore never got there; the clamp on
  //                        screen is nobody's choice, so it must not be saved.
  //   (going hidden also KEEPS, for the same reason as budget expiry.)
  // Only the first two are releases. A maintainer "fixing the asymmetry" by
  // clearing the target on the budget branch would reopen the corruption above
  // for its commonest trigger — a board that shrank overnight, so the stored
  // offset is simply unreachable this session.
  //
  // The consequence is deliberate: after a restore that did not land, saves are
  // suppressed until the operator actually scrolls. That is correct — they have
  // not chosen a position, so there is nothing to record, the stored one is
  // still the best answer, and it ages out of the 12h TTL on its own if the
  // content really has shrunk for good.

  // returns 'requests', by its own documented fallback — so a restore gated on
  // !tabFromPath(location.pathname) never fires on '/'. (Measured: the first cut of
  // this feature was gated exactly that way and the tab half of it was entirely
  // dead; the one path that DID satisfy the gate was /operator, which carries no
  // #panel-* and so was rejected by the next guard anyway.)
  //
  // ⚠ An earlier version of this asked "does the URL name a tab?" and answered it
  // with "the first path segment is non-empty" — which is true of /operator and of
  // /agents/<id>, neither of which names a tab. It reached the right OUTCOME by a
  // claim that was false, flagged by the round-0 audit on #859. The predicate is
  // the root test; say so.

  // 🔴 THESE FOUR LIVE AT IIFE TOP LEVEL, NOT INSIDE initGlobal/initPage, AND
  // THAT IS A BUG FIX RATHER THAN A STYLE CHOICE. navSaveScroll and
  // navReadScroll were first declared inside initGlobal() while restoreNav sat
  // inside initPage() — two different function scopes — so restoreNav threw
  // "navReadScroll is not defined" on every cold start. It threw AFTER the tab
  // had been switched, so the tab restore looked like it worked and only the
  // scroll silently vanished; nothing surfaced but an uncaught error in the
  // console.
  //
  // The stored form is 'offset:savedAtMillis'. navReadScroll is the only reader;
  // it returns 0 — a no-op for every caller — for a missing value, a malformed
  // one, and one older than NAV_SCROLL_TTL_MS. A value with NO timestamp reads
  // as EXPIRED rather than as trusted: that is the fail-closed direction, and it
  // is also what an offset written by a build before the TTL existed should get.
  //
  // 🔴 BOTH GUARD ON A REAL TAB *AND* A PRESENT PANEL, and the pair must stay
  // symmetric. An earlier cut guarded the SAVE both ways and the RESTORE only on
  // the tab, while a comment claimed they mirrored each other. tabFromPath
  // ('/tasks/42') is 'tasks', so a task-detail document — which renders this

  // 🔴 ONE requestAnimationFrame IS NOT ENOUGH ON THE REAL SHELL. The panels
  // lazy-load over htmx, so at the first frame the document is often SHORTER
  // than the stored offset and the browser clamps the scroll — the operator
  // lands short of where they left. (The e2e fixture cannot see this: it forces
  // a 4000px document on every load, so there is nothing to wait for.) So retry
  // across frames until the offset actually takes.
  //
  // 🔴 BOUNDED AND CANCELLABLE, because an unbounded version of exactly this is
  // the defect that made the app unusable: a restore re-applied on every swap
  // pins the viewport and the operator cannot scroll at all. This one stops the
  // moment it lands, gives up after NAV_SCROLL_SETTLE_MS, and ABORTS on the
  // first sign of real input — it must never fight the operator for the
  // scrollbar.
  //
  // 🔴 THE GUARD THAT ACTUALLY CLOSES THE WALL-CLOCK HOLE IS THE visibilitychange
  // CANCEL, NOT THE DEADLINE. requestAnimationFrame does not run in a hidden
  // document, so a frame queued just before the operator locks the phone fires
  // whenever they come back: MEASURED at a scrollTo landing 4.00 HOURS after
  // navApplyScroll started, moving the page with no input — this same defect in
  // miniature, reintroduced by its own fix. Going hidden therefore ENDS the
  // restore rather than deferring it. Pinned by 'a restore abandoned when the
  // page is backgrounded never fires later'.
  //
  // 🔴 TESTING THE DEADLINE BEFORE THE SCROLL IS THE ONLY WALL-CLOCK TERMINATOR
  // ON iOS, AND AN EARLIER COMMENT HERE CALLED IT UNREACHABLE. That was FALSE,
  // and falsified by this file's own text 300 lines down: iOS Safari — which is
  // what the PWA actually runs in — does not reliably fire visibilitychange when
  // the app is backgrounded or killed; pagehide is the event that survives the
  // bfcache path. So on the target platform the cancel does NOT win first:
  // 'done' stays false, the parked frame resumes hours later, and only
  // 'Date.now() > deadline' stops it from scrolling.
  //
  // 🔴 SO DO NOT DELETE THE DEADLINE TERM. The earlier wording invited exactly
  // that, which would leave the loop with no unconditional terminator at all on
  // a short document with no input and no visibility change — the pinning defect
  // this whole feature exists to avoid.
  //
  // It is pinned by 'a restore parked across a background period does not fire
  // when frames resume', which suspends requestAnimationFrame to build the state
  // a real backgrounded tab produces.
  // ⚠ NOT RE-ENTRANT, AND THE PROTECTION IS IN THE CALLER RATHER THAN HERE.

    // each of those is a no-op for an overlay that is already closed, and at most
    // one of them can be open at a time in practice. What matters is only the
    // combobox precedence — cbOpen(box,false) always sets .hidden, so an Escape
    // can never be swallowed by a dropdown that then fails to close.
    // A combobox dropdown is a CHILD of a dialog (the edit sheet has 2, the
    // dispatch sheet 3). "Dismiss this dropdown" must never mean "destroy this
    // dialog" — measured: ArrowDown to open the repo list, Escape, and the whole
    // sheet vanished (taking the typed dispatch prompt with it).

    // The check lives HERE, not as a stopPropagation() in the combobox's own
    // keydown at the bottom of this IIFE, because BOTH listeners are on
    // document in the BUBBLE phase and this one is registered FIRST — listener
    // order on a single node is registration order, and stopPropagation() cannot
    // reach a listener that has already run. Closing the dropdown here (rather

  // carrying data-action-url, data-action-card or data-aa-project, so the
  // listener could never fire and the counter could never leave zero.
  //
  // What survives is window.toast, which is NOT part of that machinery even
  // though it lived inside it. resyncScript's htmx:responseError and
  // htmx:sendError listeners call it by name from another IIFE, and the task
  // modal calls it too — so deleting it with its former neighbours would make
  // every failed mutation in muster fail SILENTLY, which is the exact defect
  // resyncScript exists to prevent.

//     shipped: htmx captures the verb path at process time, so the attribute and
//     the request had drifted apart and every trigger-driven refetch asked for
//     the unfiltered board. See the listener for the measurement.
//
//  2. The EDITOR's tag input: type a tag + Enter (or comma) → a chip carrying a
//     hidden `tag` input; × removes it. The visible input is deliberately
//     unnamed, so a half-typed value can never be submitted as a tag.

//   - location.replace(), NOT assign(). The board is not a place you meant to
//     stop at, so it must not become a Back-button trap: replace() swaps the
//     history entry instead of adding one, so Back returns to wherever the link
//     was clicked.
//   - THE MATCHER STAYS ANCHORED AND DIGITS-ONLY (/^#task-([0-9]+)$/).
//     `#task-1-notes` or a foreign `#task-list` anchor is somebody else's
//     fragment; claiming it would navigate away from a page the user is on.
//   - hashchange IS WIRED, not just first paint. A same-page fragment change
//     (an in-app link, a pasted #task-N) fires no navigation of its own.
//   - THE LISTENER BINDS ONCE (__cgTaskHashInit) even though the body of the
//     script re-runs: htmx re-executes in-body <script> tags on every hx-boost
//     swap, and a stacked hashchange listener would fire N redirects.

// cardMetaNavScript gives the board card's metadata chips back the card's click.
//
// 🔴 THIS IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE F6 FIX, AND WITHOUT IT F6 WAS A TRADE, NOT A
// FIX. The chips (`#id`, the dispatch/provenance/sessions chips, the tag chips
// and the `+N` overflow) sit in a row that noteCard raises above the card-link's
// stretched ::after so their `title` tooltips resolve — `relative z-10
// pointer-events-none [&>*]:pointer-events-auto`, see notes.go. The row is
// pointer-TRANSPARENT so its gaps still hit the overlay, but the chip rectangles
// themselves opt back in, and a chip that hit-tests as itself no longer hits the
// anchor — so the strip's dominant surface stopped opening the task. Tooltips
// are hover-only, so the whole cost landed on touch. (The measurement, its
// fixture and its denominator live in ONE place, on noteCard's `card-meta`
// Class() in notes.go; the figure that used to be restated here was quoted in
// four files and could not be reproduced.)
//
// The chips carry no click behaviour of their OWN — that was the reasoning that
// missed this — but they were part of the CARD's. So route their click to the
// card's link explicitly. Both halves are measured in
// e2e/tests/tasks.spec.ts ("the metadata chips are hoverable, AND a chip tap
// opens the task"); a class assertion could not see either.
//
// 🔴 IT MUST FORWARD THE GESTURE, NOT SYNTHESISE ONE, AND THE FIRST VERSION DID
// NOT. `link.click()` produces an untrusted, UNMODIFIED, button-0 click, and
// input.css already had the reason written down three files over: the stretched
// anchor exists so "keyboard focus, middle-click, ⌘-click and 'open in new tab'
// all work for free — none of which a delegated JS click handler would give".
// This IS that handler, so it owes exactly that debt. Measured on the compiled
// CSS, with the anchor's own gesture as the control:
//
//	chip   CTRL   -> anchor saw ctrlKey:false  (so it navigated THIS tab)
//	anchor CTRL   -> anchor saw ctrlKey:true   [control: instrument works]
//	chip   MIDDLE -> auxclick at the chip; the anchor's click never fired
//	middle-click on chip      -> pages 1 -> 1, url unchanged
//	middle-click on card body -> pages 1 -> 2  [control: a tab DID open]
//
// i.e. the standard triage gesture — middle- or ⌘-click a chip to queue the task
// in a background tab — did nothing on middle-click and DESTROYED THE BOARD on
// ⌘-click, 20px from a card body where both worked. So the click is forwarded
// with its modifiers and button intact, and 'auxclick' is bound as well because
// a middle-click produces no 'click' event at all. Both are asserted
// behaviourally in e2e/tests/tasks.spec.ts ("… opens the task in a new tab, as
// the card body does"), with the card link as the positive control — a listener
// existing is not the claim; the modifier ARRIVING and a second page OPENING is.
//
// Four things it deliberately does NOT do:
//
//   - it never fires when a text selection is open. A selection drag ends in a
//     mouseup that fires `click`, and nothing on the event distinguishes it from
//     a real one. Raising the row is what made the chip text selectable at all
//     (before it, the stretched ::after ate the drag), so this is a cost the
//     raise created: selecting a tag name or a truncated session id to copy it
//     used to leave the board.
//   - it never fires while merge-selection mode is on. `.selecting
//     .card-link::after { pointer-events: none }` makes a card-body click do
//     NOTHING mid-merge, on purpose (see merge.go's setMode); the chips must not
//     become the one surface that still navigates away from a half-made merge.
//   - it never hijacks a real control. Nothing interactive lives in the row
//     today, so the closest() bail is for the row as it GROWS — a chip that
//     becomes a filter link or a button keeps its own behaviour.
//   - it does nothing on the DETAIL card, which renders the same row but no
//     `a.card-link` (you are already on the task's page).
//
// Delegated on the document and bound once (__cgCardMetaNavInit), like every
// other script here: the cards are re-rendered by every list swap, and htmx
// re-executes in-body <script> tags on each hx-boost swap.
