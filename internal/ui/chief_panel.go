// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CHIEF SLIDE-OUT
//
// A right-side, resizable panel for talking to the chief agent without leaving
// the tmux grid. Its width and open/closed state are persisted and restored.
//
// 🔴 THREE CONSTRAINTS THIS ARC HAS ALREADY PAID FOR. NONE IS STYLISTIC, AND
// EACH ONE NAMES A SHIPPED DEFECT:
//
//  1. THE PANEL CANNOT HOST ITS OWN PERSISTENCE SCRIPT. #chief-panel-body is an
//     `hx-swap: innerHTML` target, so a <script> inside it is destroyed by the
//     very swap it exists to survive. chiefPanelScript therefore lives in the
//     PAGE SHELL (components.go's Page), beside the other shell scripts, and the
//     panel body carries only DOM.
//
//  2. THE STORAGE KEY IS A STABLE REFERENCE, NEVER A DESCRIPTION. Rank 11
//     shipped a drawer keyed on an archived COUNT — a number that changes on
//     exactly the swaps the memory was meant to survive, so it forgot precisely
//     when it mattered. These keys are built from the panel's own ELEMENT ID,
//     which is a constant of this file.
//
//  3. BIND ONCE, AND LISTEN ON `document`, NOT `document.body`. A once-guard
//     plus a body-scoped listener is worse than either alone: an hx-boost body
//     swap kills the listener while the guard suppresses the rebind, leaving a
//     panel that is permanently inert and a console with nothing in it.
//
// 🔴 AND IT DOES NOT SWALLOW INTERACTIONS IT ONLY OBSERVES — rank 11's mutant
// PD. The document-level click handler returns immediately for anything that is
// not one of this panel's own controls, and calls preventDefault on nothing
// else, so a <summary> click still toggles its <details> and a card's view
// toggle still flips.
//
// 🔴 IT RE-MOUNTS THE EXISTING AGENT CHAT RATHER THAN BUILDING A SECOND ONE.
// The body is agentChatPane + agentChatScript — the same #chat-log fed by
// GET /ui/agents/{name}/chat-log on `sse:chat.reply`, and the same WebSocket
// send path. A second chat would be a second transcript, a second unread ledger
// and a second place for a streaming bug to live.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	// chiefPanelActionsID is the TITLE-BAR slot the two launchers land in.
	//
	// 🔴 IT IS A SLOT FILLED OUT-OF-BAND, NOT MARKUP THE SHELL CAN RENDER, AND THE
	// REASON IS THE AGENT ID. ChiefPanel() is rendered by the shell on every tab,
	// and the shell deliberately does NOT resolve the chief — that lookup is what
	// makes the panel body lazy, and paying it on every page load would undo the
	// whole point. The new-thread control needs the chief's row id (it reuses
	// POST /agents/{id}/sessions), so it can only be built where that id is known:
	// in the body partial. The body's response therefore carries an
	// `hx-swap-oob` copy of this container, which is the established idiom in this
	// package (18 other uses in components.go).

	// gone missing — used to render "No thread matches that.", i.e. the answer to a
	// question the server never managed to ask. A guard on the WORDS is walkable by

// is therefore kept and the prompt appended to it; see the click handler in

	// have a surface area of three screens. Only chiefPanelBody constructs a
	// ChiefPanelView, so this field can only ever change what the panel draws.
	//
	// 🔴 AND IT IS THE FREQUENT PATH, WHICH IS WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. api.resolveSessions

	// different sentences and the reason this is not derived from Query != "".
	Searched bool
	// Failed says the server never got an answer — the read itself broke.
	//
	// 🔴 IT IS A THIRD STATE, NOT A FLAVOUR OF EMPTY, AND CONFLATING THEM IS THE
	// DEFECT THIS FIELD EXISTS TO CLOSE. The search route deliberately answers 200
	// with rows on every failure (htmx does not swap a non-2xx body, so a 500 leaves
	// the PREVIOUS query's matches on screen as though they were the answer) — and
	// that correct decision was rendering a Postgres error, a chief-resolution
	// failure and a genuinely empty result set as one sentence, "No thread matches
	// that.", traced only in a server log. The operator could not tell "nothing
	// matched" from "search is broken", and on the blank-query path they were told
	// their thread history was EMPTY when the list read had simply failed.
	//
	// ⚠ IT OUTRANKS Searched. A failed search has no result set to describe, so
	// there is no answer to describe and the query text is echoed only to say what was
	// being attempted.
	//
	// 🔴 IT ALSO OUTRANKS THE ROW COUNT, AND chiefThreadRows ENFORCES THAT RATHER THAN
	// TRUSTING THE CALLER — which this comment used to do, and which failed. It read
	// "Threads must be empty whenever this is set": a PRECONDITION, stated in prose,
	// honoured by the search route (it discards the list on every failure) and violated
	// by the first paint the moment that call site was added. api.resolveSessions returns
	// `views, err` from one read, and agents.PGStore.ListSessions ends `return out, rows.Err()`
	// — so a mid-stream failure (connection reset, server-side cancellation) hands the
	// panel a TRUNCATED slice AND a non-nil error. That rendered as state="rows" with no
	// failure sentence anywhere: a partial thread history presented as the whole of it.
	// The renderer now answers the failure state at EVERY row count, so a caller cannot
	// reintroduce it by forgetting; see chiefThreadRows for why the rows are dropped
	// rather than shown alongside the sentence.
	Failed bool
	// Reason replaces the failure SENTENCE when the absence of an answer is not a
	// transient read at all. Ignored unless Failed is set.
	//
	// 🔴 IT EXISTS BECAUSE "Try again." WAS A LIE IN ONE STATE. handleChiefThreadSearch
	// renders the failure state when s.ext.Agents is nil — a muster booted with no
	// database — and that read cannot succeed on a retry, not now and not ever: there is
	// no store to ask. Telling the operator to try again is an instruction that can only
	// waste their time. The STATE is still `error` (it is the absence of an answer, which
	// is exactly what that state means); only the sentence differs.

//
// 🔴 A ROW IS AN hx-get INTO THE PANEL BODY, NOT A LINK. The page surfaces use
// boosted <a href="/agents/<name>?session=<id>"> and must keep doing so — their
// tests pin it. In the panel a navigation would leave the grid, so a row asks the
// panel handler (which already honours ?session=) for that thread and swaps it
// into #chief-panel-body. It is a <button> rather than an <a> with hx-get because
// there is no URL it degrades to: without JS a bare href here would navigate,
// which is the behaviour being removed.
//
// 🔴 A FAILED READ IS ANSWERED BEFORE THE ROWS ARE EVEN COUNTED, AND THE ROWS ARE
// DROPPED. That ordering is the whole of round-3 finding 1. ChiefThreadsView.Failed
// documented "Threads must be empty whenever this is set" as a precondition on the
// CALLER; the search route honours it, the panel's first paint passed both — and a
// truncated read (agents.PGStore.ListSessions ends `return out, rows.Err()`, so a
// mid-stream failure yields rows AND an error) therefore rendered state="rows" with no
// failure sentence at all. Checking Failed here, first, makes the precondition a
// property of the renderer: no present or future call site can render a partial list
// as a complete one by forgetting to discard it.
//
// 🔴 AND THE ROWS THAT DID ARRIVE ARE NOT SHOWN BESIDE THE SENTENCE, DELIBERATELY.
// A broken read does not say how much of the answer it lost: `out, rows.Err()` can be
// the first row of hundreds or every row but one, and nothing in the error
// distinguishes them — so rows rendered here are a list of UNKNOWN completeness, drawn
// as tappable, active-highlighted, visually identical to a whole one. An operator who
// reads the rows and not the sentence above them draws exactly the false conclusion
// this arc exists to prevent. With the rows gone the warning sentence is the only thing
// in the container, so it cannot be skimmed past, and nothing reachable is lost.
//
// 🔴 AND THE RETRY IS IN PLACE, WHICH IS THE CHEAPEST ONE AND NOT THE ONE THIS COMMENT
// USED TO NAME. The search input above this list carries
// hx-trigger="input changed delay:300ms, search" against /ui/chief/threads/search, and a
// BLANK q on that route is the SAME agents.ListSessions read (api.handleChiefThreadSearch
// renders the recent list rather than an empty result set) — so a keystroke and a clear,
// or the type=search clear affordance, re-issues this read and swaps the answer over
// #chief-thread-results without the panel moving. Reopening the panel refetches the body
// too, but that is close-then-open — TWO taps, not the "one tap" this said before — and
// the threads drawer's own toggle is a pure-CSS checkbox that fetches nothing at all.
// A NON-blank query is a different read (SearchSessions) and reaches a named thread
