// Migration 0002's guards — the DATABASE half of the agent-name tombstone.
//
// 🔴 WHAT MAKES THESE DIFFERENT FROM THE PGStore GUARDS IN internal/agents.
// Those prove the GENERATOR refuses a retired name when the application deletes
// an agent through PGStore.Delete. The property THIS file pins is the one the
// trigger was chosen for over an application-level insert: the tombstone appears
// for a DELETE that never touches Go at all. An insert in Provisioner.Destroy
// would be a rule every future call site has to remember, and would cover only
// the binary that has it; a trigger has nothing to remember. A test that deletes
// through the store cannot tell the two designs apart — so these delete with raw
// SQL.
//
// ⚠ They run against this package's private, fully-migrated database (dbtest
// copies an already-migrated template), i.e. the schema the whole 0001..0002
// chain actually produced — not a scratch schema built from 0002's body alone. A
// scratch-schema fixture could not see a trigger that failed to attach to the
// real `agents`.

// pinnedConn takes ONE connection out of the pool and holds it for the test.
//
// 🔴 A POOL IS NOT A SESSION, AND THE search_path GUARD BELOW IS A CLAIM ABOUT A
// SESSION. `SET search_path` applies to the connection it runs on; issued
// through a pool, the next statement can land on a different connection and the
// hijack the test believes it installed is simply not in effect. The guard has
// its own control for that, but pinning the connection is what makes the control
// pass for the right reason.

// `public.agent_retired_names`, which is the only table PGStore.NameExists
// reads. With a decoy `<schema>.agent_retired_names` first on the calling

// the name goes back into the pool. That defeats exactly the property 0002 is
// sold on ("any call site, any binary, including a hand-run psql DELETE") — and
// a hand-run psql session is where a non-default search_path comes from.
//
// ⚠ AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS PARAGRAPH GAVE THE WRONG MECHANISM, AND THE
// CORRECTION MATTERS TO ANYONE READING THE FAILURE. It said the unqualified form
// "SUCCEEDS and writes the tombstone into the decoy — silent". That is true only
// with the function's `SET search_path = pg_catalog` ALSO removed. Measured with
// the `SET` in place, the unqualified form instead raises
// `relation "agent_retired_names" does not exist` and the DELETE ABORTS — loud,
// and fails closed. Either way this test reddens on `inPublic != 1`, so what it
// pins is unchanged; what changes is what the reader should expect to see. 0002's
// header carries all four measured combinations.
//
// Asserting `proconfig`, or grepping the function body for "public.", would be a
// check on the SPELLING of the fix. This asserts the OUTCOME, so it holds for
// either spelling and for any third one someone substitutes later.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT THEREFORE DOES NOT COVER: removing only the `SET search_path` line
// while keeping the `public.` qualification leaves this test green. With nothing
// unqualified in the function body there is no behaviour to observe, so the
// `SET` is unpinned defence-in-depth. 0002's header says why that is accepted
// rather than closed with a proconfig assertion.

// The two assertions are a pair on purpose: `shadow == 0` alone is satisfied by
