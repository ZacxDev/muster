// Package agentgateway is the CHAT half of the agent seam: it turns an agent row
// plus a live provisioner into one turn against that agent's model gateway.
//
// 🔴 IT IS A SEPARATE PACKAGE FROM internal/agentprovision, AND THE SPLIT IS THE
// SAME ONE internal/api MADE BETWEEN Provisioner AND Gateway. A driver contract
// (provision.Provisioner) has no notion of a chat turn at all: it creates, scales,
// destroys and reports. Chat is a conversation with the thing the driver created,
// over a protocol the driver knows nothing about. Behind one type the two would
// have to be wired together or not at all — and "lifecycle works, chat honestly
// refuses" is a real deployment state that api.Gateway's own doc names as such.
//
// WHAT THIS PACKAGE IS, PRECISELY: a bridge with no protocol of its own. The two
// wire formats live in internal/agents (responses.go, chatcompletions.go); the
// credential derivation lives in [Runtime]; the sentinel is configuration
// ([Config.Model]); the address comes from the driver. This package supplies the
// two inputs internal/agents deliberately would not invent — the model sentinel
// and the endpoint — and nothing else.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, STATED SO IT IS NOT INFERRED: it does not fall back from
// tools to plain chat. api.Gateway's contract puts that decision at the CALLER,
// because the caller is the only place that knows whether a toolless answer is
// acceptable for the turn it is running — a kickoff that silently lost its tools
// produces an agent that cannot read the task it was dispatched for.
//
// ⚠ IT DOES FALL BACK BETWEEN THE TWO *TRANSPORTS*, AND THE TWO ARE DIFFERENT
// DECISIONS. [Gateway.Chat] runs over /v1/responses and drops to
// /v1/chat/completions only when the runtime answers 404 there — a choice about
// which wire format an image speaks, which no caller has information about and
// which changes nothing the caller asked for. Losing TOOLS changes what the agent
// can do; changing transport does not. The reasoning-model measurement that forced
// this is on Chat.

// DefaultTurnTimeout bounds ONE REQUEST to the agent runtime — it is the default
// http.Client.Timeout, nothing more.
//
// 🔴 IT DOES *NOT* BOUND A TURN, AND THIS COMMENT SAID IT DID. The retracted
// sentence read "bounds one chat turn, including every tool round inside a
// tool-enabled one … stops a wedged turn holding a request goroutine for ever, and
// this is that". Measured false by audit: a tool-enabled turn issues up to
// agents.MaxToolLoopIterations requests, EACH getting its own budget — so the
// reachable ceiling is that many multiples of this value, plus whatever an in-process
// tool dispatch blocks for, which is under no HTTP timeout at all because
// agents.ToolDispatch takes no context.
//
// ⚠ AN EARLIER RETRACTION OF THIS PARAGRAPH ADDED ITS OWN FALSE CLAUSE — "and the loop
// only checks ctx between them" — AND THEN A FIX ROUND CLAIMED TO HAVE REMOVED IT
// WITHOUT WRITING THE FILE. Both transports build with http.NewRequestWithContext
// (responses.go, chatcompletions.go), so a caller deadline aborts an IN-FLIGHT request
// too; that is exactly why the next paragraph can say the caller's context is what
// bounds a turn. Naming the loop instead of the tool dispatch sends a reader adding a
// ceiling to the wrong layer — and a record asserting a retraction that did not happen
// is worse than the clause, because it stops the next reader checking.
//
// ⚠ SO THE THING THAT ACTUALLY BOUNDS A TURN IS THE CALLER'S CONTEXT, and this
// package deliberately does not invent one: a request-scoped ctx already carries the
// caller's own deadline, and replacing it here would silently shorten a turn the
// caller was willing to wait for. If a turn-level ceiling is wanted it belongs at the
// call site, where the deadline has an owner.

//
// 🔴 IT RUNS OVER /v1/responses AND ONLY FALLS BACK TO /v1/chat/completions ON A
// 404, BECAUSE THE STREAMING CHAT-COMPLETIONS PATH SILENTLY LOSES A REASONING
// MODEL'S ENTIRE ANSWER. The measurement is recorded on agents.RunToollessTurn: the
// same prompt to the same live agent produced zero content deltas over streaming
// chat-completions — an HTTP 200 and `{"reply":""}` out of
// POST /api/agents/{name}/messages, which is `chief ask`'s door — and the full text
// over /v1/responses. Nothing in this package could have detected it: a 200 with no
// deltas is indistinguishable here from a model that genuinely said nothing.
//
// 🔴 THE 404 FALLBACK IS THE *ONLY* ONE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE RATHER THAN
// INCOMPLETE. ErrResponsesUnsupported means the endpoint is absent (responses.go
// maps a 404 and nothing else), so chat-completions is then the only transport that
// runtime has. Every OTHER failure propagates: falling back on a 400 or a 500 would
// route the turn straight back into the transport this change exists to leave, and

// lacks /v1/responses, one turn is two requests — the 404 probe and the real call.
// That is paid only by images old enough to lack the endpoint, and it buys a caller
// that does not have to know which transport an agent's image speaks.
//
// ⚠ IT SENDS NO `instructions`, AND THAT IS PARITY RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT. The
// transport this replaces posted one user message and no system prompt at all, so
// supplying one here would change what the agent is told on a path whose only
// defect was the wire format. Chat's signature has nowhere to carry a prompt; a
