// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE REFUSAL chief_threads.go HAS CLAIMED SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN.
//
// 🔴 THIS TEST DID NOT EXIST, AND TWO COMMENTS SAID IT DID. chief_threads.go and
// server.go both told a reader that "the two non-operator credentials that reach
// other routes in this package must get a 401 here, and
// TestChiefThreadSearchIsOperatorOnly asserts both of them". Nothing in the
// suite referenced this route, requireSession, or either credential. The
// invariant was held by two lines of mux.HandleFunc and by nothing else — and
// the comments actively discouraged anyone from checking, which is worse than
// silence. GET /ui/chief/threads/search returns MESSAGE CONTENT: an excerpt cut
// out of a chat message body.
//
// 🔴 THE CREDENTIALS PRESENTED HERE ARE GENUINELY VALID ONES, NOT NONSENSE
// STRINGS. That is the whole discrimination. A test that presents "not-a-token"
// and gets 401 passes identically whether the route is behind requireSession,
// requireHookToken or requireAgentToken — it measures nothing about the tier.
// The hook token below IS this server's configured hook token, and the agent
// token below DOES resolve to an agent row through the store. Both would be
// ADMITTED by the middleware on neighbouring routes in this package; they are
// refused here.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// agent credential presented below is one requireAgentToken would accept.
