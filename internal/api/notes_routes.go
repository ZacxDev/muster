// handler below answers the nil-store case itself, so a no-database boot serves
// a Tasks tab that says why it is empty instead of a tab whose partial 404s.

	// 🔴 No mux conflict with POST /tasks/merge (POST-only) or with

	// fail-closed auth ledger rather than merely unlisted. Per that guard's own
	// instruction — "a duplicated string that is pinned is safer than a computed
	// one that is unreadable" — the literal lives here and

	// half of moving the operator's job onto chief: measured against the live pod,
	// GET /api/tasks answered 401 to chief's own credential, so chief could be told
	// to work the board and could not see it. The list already EMBEDS each task's
	// comments, attachments and agent, so widening it grants the capability without
	// also widening the by-id read.

	// deletion is owed to Phase 4; deleting it earlier costs chief the board read that
	// task #633 existed to give it. ⚠ THESE TWO TASK
	// ROUTES MOVE TO muster IN PHASE 4 and are deliberately NOT special-cased on the
	// way: they ride the renamed wrapper like the other four. Adding routes to that

	//
	// 🔴 THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE EXPANSION IN TASK #633, SAID OUT LOUD. Chief becomes
	// able to mark ANY task complete. The reason that is judged acceptable is the
	// one the card records: a DISPATCHED worker is structurally denied `complete`
	// (notes.StatusAllowedForAgent, on its own /agent/task/status route) precisely
	// so an agent cannot grade its own exam, and chief does not pick up tasks. The
	// narrowing that keeps that true here is requireHookOrServiceToken's — it admits
	// ONE service credential and ONE agent row, not any agent pod. The caller it names
	// is asserted by that service on the first, and resolved from the row on the
	// second. If chief ever works tasks, revisit this.

	// provenance allowlist — never from the body — so a caller ON THIS ROUTE can never
	// claim to be the privileged `user`/`operator`. ⚠ Scope: that binds this route, not
	// the system. The session routes (`POST /tasks/{id}/comments`, `POST /tasks/merge`)

	// session cookie — so `user` is no longer mintable by any machine on the LAN, but
