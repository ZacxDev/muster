// ROUTE DRIFT GATE — forked from the project muster is being extracted from,
// where it is the migration's only mechanical proof that no route was dropped
// in the carve.
//
// WHAT THIS IS: muxRecorder is the second implementer of Mux. Handing it to
// RegisterRoutes — the same function a real server calls, and the only
// registration site in the module — records exactly what production
// registers. That sorted set is diffed against a CHECKED-IN golden file, so
// agreement is a real assertion rather than a tautology: the golden is not
// generated from the same source the recorder walks. A route added, removed,
// re-pathed or re-verbed cannot land without a human eyeballing a golden diff.
//
// TO REGENERATE after an intentional route change:
//
//	UPDATE_ROUTES_GOLDEN=1 go test ./internal/api -run TestRoutesMatchGolden
//
// then READ the diff in `git diff` before committing it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 🔴 KNOWN LIMIT, CARRIED FORWARD VERBATIM IN SUBSTANCE: THIS GATE DOES NOT
// SEE AUTH.
//
// The recorder's HandleFunc receives an ALREADY-WRAPPED
// func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request). By the time a handler reaches the
// mux, a wrapper that demands a session and a wrapper that demands nothing are
// the same type and are indistinguishable. So this gate catches ROUTE drift
// but NOT a route silently moving between authorisation tiers.
//
// 🔴 IN muster THAT LIMIT IS WORSE THAN IT WAS UPSTREAM, AND THIS IS THE
// SENTENCE TO READ TWICE. Upstream that blindness covered three wrappers on
// one process. The extraction plan's auth section counts FIVE doors already
// live upstream — a machine bearer token that is enforce-when-set (unset means
// OPEN), a browser session, a terminal token, an agent-resolved token and a
// browser-terminal tier — and specifies a SIXTH, fail-closed service-to-service
// door for exactly this split. Six tiers, one of which fails OPEN when its
// secret is missing, and a gate that cannot tell any of them apart. The plan
// names getting a route's tier wrong as one of the two most likely ways the
// carve ships broken.
//
// So: a clean diff from this gate is evidence about PATHS ONLY. It is not
// evidence that a moved route kept its tier, and it must never be quoted as
// such in a carve review. Closing that needs authorisation captured at
// registration time — a register-with-tier shim, or a declarative route table
// — and is deliberately out of scope here, as it was upstream.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 🔴 THE PRE-TRAFFIC DECISION, STATED RATHER THAN MADE SILENTLY.
//
// muster has no HTTP server and no routes yet. A gate forked into that state
// has two obvious shapes and BOTH are known failures:
//
//   - skip, or compare an empty golden against an empty recording and pass.
//     That is a green produced by there being nothing to check. It appears in
//     the run beside the real tests with the same tick and reads as coverage
//     of exactly the layer that has none.
//   - assert the routes that Phase 2 will eventually register. That is red
//     from the first commit until the carve finishes, and a permanently-red
//     gate is worse than no gate: it trains everyone to click through, and
//     then the one real failure is clicked through too.
//
// The shape chosen instead is a declared PHASE (`routePhase`, below) with a
// different load-bearing assertion in each:
//
//	pre-traffic  the golden is empty, the recording is empty, AND the module's
//	             own sources contain no literal route pattern anywhere. The
//	             third clause is what removes the vacuity: the empty set is
//	             checked against the CODE, not merely against another empty
//	             set. Add a route anywhere without wiring it through
//	             RegisterRoutes and flipping the phase, and this fails.
//	carving      the real set-equality gate is live. The floor is NOT enforced,
//	             because during an incremental carve any floor above the
//	             current count is a permanently-red gate — see routeFloor.
//	carved       the floor is armed too.
//
// THE TRADE-OFF THIS BUYS AND WHAT IT COSTS: the phase is a hand-maintained
// declaration, so it can be wrong. It is one constant, in this file, and two
// of the three transitions are forced by a test failure rather than by
// memory — a route appearing under `pre-traffic` fails; reaching `carved`
// fails the manifest test until the manifest is deleted. Only the
// `carving` -> `carved` flip is unforced, and the partition manifest's
// delete-by condition names it explicitly as part of the same pull request.

// floor with no live provenance drifts into decoration, and nobody notices,

//	  82   rows the manifest assigns to `muster`
//	+ 14   rows it assigns to `shared` — the shell/infra surface BOTH projects
//	       register, duplicated rather than moved, so muster registers them too
//	----
//	  96   projected post-carve registrations   (= routeFloorProjection)
//	- 16   carve margin, ~17%: routes the carve is expected to drop or fold
//	       rather than move (the manifest's own header flags a five-row block
//	       it is least certain about, and two more rows whose fate the source
//	       plan contradicts itself on)
//	----
//	  80   routeFloor
//
// Derived 2026-09 from a 162-route upstream golden. The month, not the day, is
// deliberate: this repository's leak gate refuses a dated observation claim,
// and that gate is not to be edited to accommodate a comment.
//
// 🔴 TODO(muster-phase2-floor): REPLACE THIS PROJECTION WITH A MEASUREMENT.
// The measurement that settles it, and the only one that does: after the code
// carve, regenerate testdata/routes.golden against the carved tree, count its
// route lines, and set routeFloor to that count less a small margin — writing
// the measured count and the month beside it, as this comment does. Until that
// happens, 80 is a projection. Do not quote it as a measurement, and do not
// "fix" a red floor by lowering it to whatever number makes the run green:
// that is the failure this whole comment exists to prevent, and it has already
