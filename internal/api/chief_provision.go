// --- provisioning the chief agent -----------------------------------------
//
// 🔴 THIS IS THE ONE HANDLER THAT MOVED OUT OF A FILE THAT OTHERWISE STAYED.
// Its former home is the terminal-WRITE door — the agent-identified spelling of
// `send-keys`, with its operator-approval hop — and every other line in that
// file is about a surface muster does not have. This handler is about the AGENT,
// which is muster's, so it travelled alone. The extraction plan names this split
// explicitly, because a whole-file move in either direction would have been
// wrong in a way that compiles.

// handleChiefProvision creates the agent NAMED `chief`, or starts it if it is
// already there. It was written to mirror handleOperatorProvision exactly, because
// chief was the second reserved-name agent and the first already had this shape.
// ⚠ That sibling was deleted in upstream task #653 phase two, so there is nothing
// left to compare it against — do not read this as a live symmetry.
//
// 🔴 IT EXISTS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY TO CREATE ONE. Agent names come from
// agents.BuildUniqueAgentName, an adjective-noun pool (`zesty-stoat`), and the
// dispatch form has no name field — so after 0.8.47 reserved `chief` and branched
// the agent's instructions on that name, NOTHING in the system could produce an
// agent the branch would fire for. The instructions were unreachable and every
// release from 0.8.47 to 0.8.50 was inert for want of this route.
//
// ⚠ IT DOES NOT EXPOSE ARBITRARY NAMING, DELIBERATELY. The obvious alternative —
// a `name` field on the dispatch form — is a wider surface that has to validate a
// k8s-safe slug, guard collisions with the pool, and reject the reserved names it
// must not let a human mint. dispatchParams.Name already existed for exactly this
// case; this route WAS its second caller, not a new capability. ⚠ It is now the
// ONLY one — upstream task #653 phase two deleted handleOperatorProvision, the
// first — and that is what makes `operator` unmintable. agents.go's chatTurn header
// carries the argument and its two pins.
