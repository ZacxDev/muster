// THE SEAM BETWEEN api.Gateway AND ITS FIRST REAL IMPLEMENTATION.
//
// 🔴 IT IS THE CHAT TWIN OF lifecycle_adapter_seam_test.go, AND IT EXISTS FOR THE
// SAME REASON AT THE OPPOSITE END. That file asserts the lifecycle adapter
// satisfies api.Provisioner and must NOT satisfy api.Gateway. This one asserts the
// gateway satisfies api.Gateway and must NOT satisfy api.Provisioner — because the
// hazard is symmetric and the shape of the mistake is identical: a type that
// satisfies both is a type that can be wired into either field, and the split's
// entire purpose was that a deployment can turn one tier on while the other keeps
// refusing honestly.
//
// 🔴 WHAT WOULD GO WRONG IF *Gateway SATISFIED api.Provisioner. Nine lifecycle
// routes stop refusing at api.requireLifecycleProvisioner. A dispatch would then
// answer 200, create nothing, and leave a row in `provisioning` for ever — which is
// the exact observable cmd/muster-server/doc_seams.go entry 1 was written about, and
// the one a satisfied interface reports in silence.
