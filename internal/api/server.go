// Package api is muster's HTTP surface: the Server, its dependencies, and the
// single place a route may be registered.
//
// 🔴 ROUTE REGISTRATION IS UNCONDITIONAL, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE DEPARTURE
// FROM THE CODE THIS WAS CARVED OUT OF.
//
// Upstream, roughly half the route table sits behind `if s.ext.X == nil {
// return }` guards, so the set of registered routes is a function of the
// FIXTURE as much as of the code. That is not a hypothetical cost: it left that
// project's route golden seven routes short, with two separate guards green
// over the hole, because the fixture the recorder used had one dependency
// unset. The golden then described the fixture and was read as describing
// production.
//
// Here, every route registers on every boot and each handler answers its own
// "this server has nothing to serve from" case — a 503 naming the missing
// dependency, or a rendered panel saying so on screen. Three things follow, and
// they are the reason this is worth the handful of extra nil checks:
//
//   - the route golden is a claim about the CODE. `RegisterRoutes` takes no
//     fixture and cannot be given one, so there is no configuration in which
//     the recording and production disagree. TestRegistrationIsIndependentOfDependencies
//     asserts exactly that, by recording from a bare server AND a fully-wired
//     one and demanding set equality.
//   - a no-database boot serves a UI that explains itself instead of a
//     navigation of 404s. A panel that says "no database is configured" is a
//     better first run than a tab whose partial 404s silently.
//   - "which routes exist" stops being a thing a reader has to simulate.
//
// The precedent is upstream's own: its seam and gate registrars are
// unconditional for this exact reason, and their comments say so.
