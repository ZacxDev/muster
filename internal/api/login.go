// --- The human login tier ----------------------------------------------------
//
// 🔴 THIS PAGE IS DELIBERATELY NOT AN internal/ui DOCUMENT, and the reason is
// operational rather than stylistic. It is the one page that must render while
// the rest of the app is refusing, so it carries no shared shell, no htmx, no
// sidebar and no dependency on the ui package's component graph — a refactor
// there cannot lock the operator out. It also keeps it out of that package's
// standaloneDocuments registry, which would otherwise subject a bare auth form
// to ~20 shell/tab/panel sweeps that have nothing to say about it.
//
// ⚠ THAT DODGES THE a11y SWEEPS, SO THE COVERAGE IS REPLACED, NOT DROPPED:
// TestLoginPageIsAccessible pins the properties those sweeps would have checked
// (exactly one h1, a label bound to the input, no low-contrast idiom, a typed
// password field with the right autocomplete) against this markup specifically.

// loginPath is the login route, spelled once so the handler, the redirect in
// refuseUnauthenticated and the tests cannot drift.
const loginPath = "/login"

// loginRateBurst / loginRateWindow bound password guesses.
//
// 🔴 THE BUCKET IS PROCESS-WIDE, NOT PER-IP, AND THAT IS THE CONSERVATIVE
// CHOICE HERE. A per-IP bucket is keyed on something the caller picks — on a LAN
// an attacker has the whole subnet to rotate through, and behind the ingress
// every request shares one source. A shared bucket means a determined guesser
// can lock the operator out for the window, which is the trade taken on purpose:
// this secret protects a remote shell, and a brief self-inflicted lockout is
// cheaper than an unbounded guessing rate. The window is short enough that the
// operator's own retry succeeds within a minute.
const (
	loginRateBurst  = 10
	loginRateWindow = time.Minute
)

// loginPathFor returns where an unauthenticated caller should be sent, carrying
// the path it was trying to reach so login can return it there.
//
// Only the path+query of the CURRENT request is preserved, and it is re-emitted
// as a relative URL — never a caller-supplied absolute one. That is what stops
// this becoming an open redirect: see safeReturnTo.
func loginPathFor(r *http.Request) string {
	want := r.URL.RequestURI()
	if want == "" || want == "/" || strings.HasPrefix(want, loginPath) {
		return loginPath
	}
	return loginPath + "?next=" + url.QueryEscape(want)
}

// safeReturnTo sanitises the ?next= parameter.
//
// 🔴 AN OPEN REDIRECT IS THE STANDARD BUG IN EXACTLY THIS PARAMETER, so the rule
// is allow-list shaped rather than deny-list shaped: the value must begin with a
// single "/" and must not begin with "//" (which a browser reads as a
// scheme-relative URL to ANOTHER HOST — the case a naive `strings.HasPrefix(v,
// "/")` check lets straight through). Anything else falls back to "/".
func safeReturnTo(v string) string {
	if v == "" || !strings.HasPrefix(v, "/") || strings.HasPrefix(v, "//") {

	// can also escape the origin. Reject anything with one rather than reason
	// about which browser does what.

}

// registerLoginRoutes wires the human login tier. These routes are OPEN by
// necessity — they are how a caller stops being anonymous — and they are the
// only browser-facing routes that are.
// 🔴 THE PATTERNS ARE WRITTEN AS LITERALS, NOT AS "GET "+loginPath, AND THAT IS
// LOAD-BEARING. Four ledgers in this package reason about routes by reading the
// SOURCE (terminal_write_ledger_test.go, and the human-tier ledger in
// browser_auth_test.go), and a computed pattern is invisible to every one of
// them — a `send-keys` route added that way would reach a real host with no
// ledger and nothing red. TestTheLoginPathConstantMatchesItsRoutes pins the
// literal against loginPath, so the duplication cannot drift.
