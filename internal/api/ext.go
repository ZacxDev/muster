// Extensions are the server's optional dependencies. A Server built without
// them still boots, serves the shell, answers /health and /readyz, and refuses
// every data route with a reason — which is the behaviour a first run against
// no database should have.
//
// 🔴 THIS STRUCT IS THE muster HALF OF A STRUCT THAT USED TO HOLD EIGHTEEN
// FIELDS, AND THE NINE THAT ARE MISSING ARE MISSING ON PURPOSE. Upstream it
// also carried Suggest, Attention, Tmux, Transcripts, TranscriptArchive,
// TermWrite, Layout, AutoApprove and GenSuggestions — every one of which backs
// a surface on the permission router's side of the route partition. Carrying
// them across would give this service nine dependencies it has no route for,
// and would make the extraction's central claim — that the two halves are
// separable — false in the type system while looking true in the diff.
//
// 🔴 `Suggest` IS THE ONE WHOSE ABSENCE IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN TIDY, AND
// IT MUST NOT COME BACK. It is the store that owns the session table, and the
// whole of the upstream work that preceded this carve existed to remove that
// table from the domain layer so the domain layer could move without it. The
// bit it used to supply — SessionLink.DetailAvailable — is now composed from a
// SEAM instead; see UseExtensions and session_liveness.go. A reviewer who sees
// a `Suggest` field reappear here should read that as the extraction being
// undone, not as a convenience.

	// and NOT a default this package chooses.
	//
	// 🔴 IT IS HERE BECAUSE A HARDCODED CONSTANT WAS SHIPPED IN ITS PLACE AND
	// DISAGREED WITH THE DRIVER, SILENTLY. The row-writing handler used
	// agents.NamespaceFor(name) over agents.NamespacePrefix ("devpod-") while the
	// driver created `muster-agent-<name>`. Nothing fails when those differ: the
	// value is recorded, served on GET /api/agents and labelled onto the
	// instance's objects, and NOTHING places anything with it — so a card names a
	// namespace that holds nothing and reads as "never provisioned" while the
	// instance runs one namespace over. Measured live.
	//
	// 🔴 EMPTY IS NOT A SUPPORTED PRODUCTION STATE WHEN AGENTS CAN BE CREATED, and
	// defects() says so rather than this comment: an unset prefix beside a wired
	// Agents store and Provisioner means the wiring was FORGOTTEN, and the
	// consequence is the defect above rather than a missing feature. It resolves

	// session table stays with the permission router. Nil is TOLERATED and is not
	// a supported production state: the wrapper still applies, but every link
	// resolves to false and the three-state transcript row collapses to two. See

	// CONSEQUENCE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE OF defects()' SECOND ENTRY. A
	// nil Provisioner dims a tab. A nil applier BESIDE a wired Provisioner and a
	// wired Privilege store is a READINESS DEFECT: /readyz refuses, because the
	// grant chip then claims a permission a real ServiceAccount does not have. The
	// two nils look alike at the call site and do not behave alike at the pod.

	// There is one now — cmd/muster-server builds internal/agentprivilege over the

// 🔴 THE DISTINCTION IS "DEGRADES VISIBLY" VERSUS "LIES SILENTLY", AND IT IS
// THE ONLY test applied here. A nil Runbooks store is not a defect: the
// Runbooks tab renders an empty list, which is TRUE — this server has no
// runbooks. A notes store with no liveness probe IS a defect: every transcript
// row renders "no transcript recorded" over transcripts that may be perfectly

//
// 🔴 THE CONSEQUENCE IS /readyz, NOT A PANIC, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. A panic
// in a wiring call is a crash loop that takes the whole service down over a

// liveness, and keeps the pod OUT OF SERVICE until someone reads the reason —
// which handleReady prints. It is the loudest signal that is not also an

	// 🔴 THIS ENTRY IS cmd/muster-server/doc_seams.go ENTRY 2 FALLING DUE, AND

	// one: there was no surface on which a user was told a privilege was live when
	// it was not, because there was no live agent. A wired Provisioner creates
	// real instances, so the grant chip becomes a page stating a falsehood — the
	// chip says granted over a ServiceAccount with none of the permissions — and
	// that is the "lies silently" side of this function's own line.

	// ⚠ IT IS FAIL-CLOSED AND IT WILL REFUSE A DEPLOYMENT THAT USED TO COME UP.

	// THAT SAID OTHERWISE IS REPLACED RATHER THAN LEFT TO READ AS OPEN. It said:
	// "That is the point and it is the choice entry 2 offered: wire a
	// PrivilegeApplier in the same change, or make the combination unready." The
	// second option was taken in 2026-09, when the operator's standing decision was
	// that privilege stays WHOLE in the permission router — route, store AND
	// applier — which left nothing in this module able to satisfy the interface, so
	// the only exits were unsetting the provisioner or unsetting the database. THAT
	// DECISION WAS REVERSED (2026-09-28): internal/agentprivilege implements the
	// interface over the SAME provisioning driver the lifecycle tier holds, and
	// cmd/muster-server wires it behind MUSTER_AGENT_PRIVILEGE_APPLY (off by
	// default, because applying a grant needs RBAC-writing permissions muster's own
	// ServiceAccount may well not have — internal/provision/k8s.PolicyRBACPrerequisite
	// enumerates them, and it is MORE than the `escalate` and `bind` verbs this
	// paragraph used to name on their own).
	//
	// ⚠ "A DEPLOYMENT CHOICE" IS WHAT THIS HEADING USED TO CLAIM, AND IT
	// OVERSTATED BY ONE ESCAPE. Setting the variable is a deployment choice;
	// unsetting it again is NOT, because on the only kind of deployment that can
	// arm it — one with a database and a provisioner — taking it away re-enters
	// this very defect and pulls the pod from its Service. The tier arms forward
	// cheaply and rolls back expensively; cmd/muster-server/provisioner.go
	// prerequisite 2 states the asymmetry in full.
	//
	// 🔴 NONE OF WHICH CHANGES THIS FUNCTION — THE PREDICATE AND ITS THREE CONJUNCTS
	// ARE UNTOUCHED, AND THAT IS WORTH STATING BECAUSE THE OBVIOUS READING OF
	// "AN APPLIER EXISTS NOW" IS THAT THE CHECK CAN RELAX. It cannot: the check is
	// about whether THIS SERVER can apply what it records, and an unarmed applier
	// is as unable as an absent one. What the reversal changes is the refusal TEXT
	// below, which now names a variable an operator can set.
	//
	// ⚠ IT OVER-TRIGGERS FOR A PROVISIONER THAT CREATES NOTHING, and that is still
	// stated rather than fixed. The noop driver records instead of provisioning, so
	// a grant over one of its instances lies about a pod that was never real either
	// — harmless. Distinguishing the two would mean this function reading the
	// driver's capabilities, which makes a readiness check depend on a backend's
	// self-report; the fail-closed direction is cheaper and wrong only in the
	// direction of refusing to serve. ⚠ AND THE ESCAPE FROM THE OVER-TRIGGER IS NOW
	// CHEAP RATHER THAN ABSENT, which is the one thing the reversal does change
	// here: arming the applier over the noop driver satisfies this check and makes
	// every grant FAIL LOUDLY (provision.Grant refuses a driver that implements no
	// PolicyGranter, naming it) instead of being recorded silently. So the
	// over-trigger no longer forces a choice between an unready pod and a lie.

	// ⚠ IT DELETES THE ROW ONLY WHEN THE BACKEND HOLDS NOTHING, and this doc did
	// not say so — which is the contract the lifecycle adapter added. A terminal
	// ownership refusal or an unreachable backend KEEPS the row, because the row is
	// then the only record of a live instance.
	//
	// ⚠ ITS PREVIOUS WORDING WAS "uninstalls the release and deletes the
	// namespace" — helm and Kubernetes vocabulary in an interface whose Instances
	// doc makes a 🔴 point of having removed exactly that, and false for any driver

	// KickoffUndeliverableReason answers why this process cannot deliver an
	// agent's FIRST TURN, and "" when it can. It must not create, write or
	// provision anything: it is the question Dispatch answers by refusing, asked
	// before anything exists to refuse over.
	//
	// 🔴 IT IS ON THIS INTERFACE RATHER THAN BEING A TYPE ASSERTION, AND THE
	// POLARITY OF THE FAILURE IS WHY. An optional interface that an
	// implementation does not satisfy yields ok=false and leaves NO TRACE —
	// doc_seams.go entry 3 is about exactly that — and here the no-trace branch
	// is the permissive one: no pre-flight, so a dispatch the deployment cannot
	// satisfy answers 200 again and the operator is back to reading a `running`
	// card over an agent nobody told what to do. A method on the interface makes
	// omitting it a compile error instead.
	//
	// 🔴 A CALLER MUST NOT RE-DERIVE THIS FROM ITS OWN CONFIGURATION. The answer
	// has to be the SAME fact the implementation's own Dispatch branches on, or
	// the pre-flight and the dispatch disagree — which is worse than no
	// pre-flight, because it refuses requests that would have worked or admits
	// ones that will not. internal/agentprovision returns the field Dispatch
	// reads; see its own doc on why.
	//
	// ⚠ "" IS DELIVERABLE, so the zero return is the permissive one. The
	// fail-closed argument lives on agentprovision.Config.KickoffDeliverable,
	// where a wiring can FORGET a struct field; a method cannot be forgotten.

// 🔴 IT IS A SEPARATE INTERFACE FROM Provisioner, AND THE SPLIT IS THE WHOLE
// POINT. Both used to be one, behind one nil and one wrapper, so the seven
// LIFECYCLE methods could not be wired without also claiming the two CHAT ones.
// That is not a packaging preference: provision.Provisioner — the driver contract
// a lifecycle adapter is built on — has no notion of a chat turn at all, so an
// adapter over it can implement the seven honestly and the two not at all. Behind
// one interface the only ways to express that were to wire a stub (which
// doc_seams.go entry 1 rejects, because dispatch reporting success over a pod that
// does not exist is the defect the wrapper was built to remove) or to leave
// lifecycle unwired for as long as chat is. Two interfaces make "lifecycle works,
// chat honestly refuses" sayable.
//
// ⚠ A DEPLOYMENT MAY WIRE EITHER, BOTH, OR NEITHER, and each combination has a
// truthful rendering. Chat without lifecycle is unusual but not incoherent — an
// installation whose instances are provisioned by something else entirely.

	// itself — the one documented on agentgateway.Gateway.Chat runs over the
	// responses endpoint and drops to chat-completions on a 404 — because no caller
