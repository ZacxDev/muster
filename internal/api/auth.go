//     script on both hosts and travelling in cleartext to the LAN NodePort many
//     times a day, so it NAMES NO CALLER. This door's whole content is an asserted
//     identity; admitting the secret every hook holds would let any of them assert

//   - identical to UIPassword — 🔴 AND THIS ONE IS NOT PARANOIA. uiSessionSecret
//     DERIVES the browser session-cookie signing key from that password, so a

// THIS WRAPPER ONLY — requireHookOrServiceToken still performs that lookup for its

// requireHookOrServiceToken admits THREE credentials: the server's shared hook
// token, unattributed; the service token together with an ASSERTED actor name; and
// the ONE agent row the server's MUSTER_CHIEF_TOKEN names, resolved through
// Agents.GetByHooksToken.
//
// 🔴 IT REPLACED HALF OF requireHookOrAgentToken AND ONLY HALF. That wrapper
// admitted (a) the shared hook token and (b) the ONE agent row MUSTER_CHIEF_TOKEN
// named. The extraction plan (§2.1) says to accept "the service token + asserted
// actor INSTEAD OF an agent-row lookup", i.e. add a way in that does not need the
// row. Half (a) MUST stay: the two real Claude Code shell hooks POST /api/attention
// on the shared secret (§2.2 — they are 100% staying), and removing it breaks the
// highest-traffic operator-visible surface on both hosts.
//
// 🔴 HALF (b) IS STILL HERE, AND ITS DELETION IS OWED TO PHASE 4 RATHER THAN DONE
// NOW. §4.4 does say the sixth door "deletes … the agent half of
// requireHookOrAgentToken outright", but that deletion is SEPARABLE from §2.1's
// actual requirement — that muster be ABLE to call these routes — which the service
// branch already satisfies. Deleting it in the same change is a privilege
// REMOVAL nobody asked for, and it was not hypothetical upstream: when that
// analysis was done the server's chief credential and the `agents` row named
// `chief` held the same value, and that pod was Running. Cutting
// this branch removes six capabilities from a pod that is running right now, while
// the agent's own instruction text still tells that pod it has them — and that
// text exists because "an agent that does not know this retries a refused route
// and reports an outage, which is exactly what happened".
//
// ⚠ THAT INSTRUCTION TEXT IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY, AND THIS COMMENT USED TO
// CITE IT BY FILENAME AS THOUGH IT WERE. It lives upstream, alongside the pod's
// helm values; muster carries neither. See the closing condition recorded in
// internal/provision — the seam that would hold muster's own version of it has
// no producer yet, which is precisely why the deletion cannot be sequenced from
// inside this repository alone.
//
// 🔴 AND THE STATED RE-GRANT PATH ARGUES AGAINST THE NEW DOOR'S OWN DESIGN. "Issue
// chief MUSTER_SERVICE_TOKEN" is the substitute §4.4 offers, but
// ServiceWriteRefusal's third refusal rejects the HOOK token here precisely because
// a widely-held secret "would let any of them assert any name". Putting the
// asserted-identity credential inside an LLM-driven pod with a repo checkout is that
// same collapse one step down: requireAttentionOwnership scopes on the ASSERTED
// name, so a holder could resolve another actor's entries. So the three branches
// stay until Phase 4 moves them together, and WHAT HAS TO MOVE TOGETHER IS NAMED:
// the agent's prompt (its route list), the rendering that supplies the pod's
// credential set, and the machine-readable statement of what the pod can reach.
//
// ⚠ ALL THREE ARE UPSTREAM, NOT HERE, AND NAMING THEM AS LOCAL SYMBOLS WAS A
// STALE CLAIM THIS COMMENT CARRIED THROUGH THE EXTRACTION. muster has no prompt
// text, no helm values and no capability manifest — `grep` finds none of the
// three. Deleting this branch without them is how the documented incident gets
// recreated on purpose, and the point of saying so HERE is that a reader of this
// file cannot discharge the condition from this repository.
//
// 🔴 THE ORDER IS CHEAP-FIRST, AND THE CHIEF NARROWING IS DELIBERATELY LAST. The two
// constant-time comparisons cost no I/O and are tried before the DB lookup, so an
// unauthenticated caller on the LAN NodePort cannot cause a SELECT with a value that
// was going to be admitted anyway. Within the row branch the chief checks sit AFTER
// the row lookup, and that ordering is load-bearing: comparing against ChiefToken
// first would be cheaper and would make the wrong-agent refusal UNREACHABLE for the
// case it exists to refuse — a valid, resolvable credential belonging to the WRONG
// agent would be rejected by the earlier comparison and this branch would never
// execute.
//
// ⚠ ENFORCE-WHEN-SET IS INHERITED FROM requireHookToken, NOT INTRODUCED, and it is
// kept EXACTLY as it was: with no hook token configured this serves everyone, so
// every fail-closed claim here is scoped to a server that has one — production's
// state. Changing that polarity is a separate decision with its own blast radius
// (see requireHookToken's header for what "open" means on the LAN NodePort).
//
// 🔴 THE EMPTY-TOKEN GUARD IS LOAD-BEARING TWICE OVER. The store resolves
// `WHERE hooks_token=$1` (agents/pgstore.go), so one row with an empty hooks_token
// would be returned for a request carrying NO credential — without this guard the
// tier is an open endpoint. It also gives an uncredentialed caller the refusal that
// NAMES the absence rather than the one about a token that is "neither".
//
// ⚠ ALL THREE BRANCHES PUT THEIR RESULT THROUGH THE ONE CONTEXT KEY
// (serviceActorCtxKey) — the hook branch by leaving it absent, the other two by
// setting the name they resolved. Two parallel keys would mean handleAttentionRaise
// and requireAttentionOwnership saw an actor through one door and nothing through
// another, which for the ownership check means "the operator's own tier", i.e. the
// scoping silently inverted. What differs between the two attributed branches is
// where the name COMES FROM: the row branch RESOLVES it from the database, the
// service branch BELIEVES the caller — see requireServiceToken for that widening
// stated in full.

		// so a privileged in-cluster agent could read and advance the task board
		// while the board lived on the other service, and the extraction plan
		// recorded its removal as owed to the phase that moved those routes.
		//
		// These ARE those routes. They moved, so the debt falls due here: an agent
		// that wants muster's board presents a service credential and asserts its
		// own name like any other caller, and muster holds no per-agent secret it
		// would have to resolve. What the branch cost while it existed was a
		// credential living inside an LLM-driven pod with a repository checkout,
		// carrying an asserted identity — and the refusal ladder guarding it was
		// four checks deep because a single missing one handed the tier to the
		// whole fleet.
		//
		// ⚠ WHAT THIS CHANGES FOR AN EXISTING CALLER, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED:
		// a pod presenting its per-agent token to these two routes now gets a 401.
