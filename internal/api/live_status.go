// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE PLACE THE DISPLAYED AGENT STATUS IS DECIDED.
//
// 🔴 THIS REPLACES THE SAME FOUR LINES OPEN-CODED AT SIX CALL SITES, AND
// CONSOLIDATING THEM IS WHAT MADE A LATENT DEFECT AUDIBLE RATHER THAN JUST
// TIDY. Each site read:
//
//	status := a.Status
//	if s.ext.Provisioner != nil {
//	    if pods, err := s.ext.Provisioner.Pods(ctx); err == nil {
//	        status = agents.ComputeStatus(a, agents.PodIndex(pods)[a.Namespace])
//	    }
//	}
//
// — keyed on a.Namespace, because upstream's index was keyed on the pod's
// Kubernetes namespace. muster's index is keyed on the instance's Ref.Name,
// because [provision.Instance] states Group is EMPTY for a driver with no
// namespacing concept, so a group-keyed index collapses every instance onto the
// key "" and the last one wins. A namespace-keyed lookup against a name-keyed
// index does not fail: it returns nil, ComputeStatus takes its nil-instance
// branch, and every agent renders "stopped" while running perfectly. Silent, on
// every surface, with nothing logged.
//
// Six copies is six chances to fix five of them. One function is one place the
// key is spelled, and liveStatus is the only caller of InstanceIndex in this
// package — TestLiveStatusIsTheOnlyStatusComposer asserts that.
//
// ⚠ A FAILED INSTANCE READ FALLS BACK TO THE STORED STATUS RATHER THAN
// ERRORING, WHICH IS THE PRE-EXISTING BEHAVIOUR AND IS KEPT DELIBERATELY. The
// stored status is stale but not wrong — it is what this agent last was — and
// the alternative on a provisioner blip is a 500 on the whole board. This is a
// different judgement from the session-liveness probe next door, which DOES
// propagate its error, and the difference is which way the wrong answer reads:
// a stale agent status self-corrects on the next poll, while a false
// "no transcript recorded" is permanent-looking and was read as retention.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// instanceIndex returns the live instance index keyed by agent name, or nil
// when there is no provisioner or the read failed.
//
// A nil map is a usable map for reads, so callers may index it directly — but
// they must distinguish nil from empty before deciding whether live state was
// OBSERVED. See liveStatusIndexed.

// liveStatusIndexed composes one agent's displayed status against an index the

//
// 🔴 A nil INDEX MEANS "LIVE STATE WAS NOT OBSERVED" AND FALLS BACK TO THE
// STORED STATUS. An EMPTY (non-nil) index means "observed, and this agent is
// not running", which ComputeStatus resolves to stopped. Those are different
// answers and the nil check is what keeps them apart — collapsing them would
// report every agent stopped whenever the provisioner was briefly unreachable.
