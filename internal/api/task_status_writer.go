// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHO writes a task status.
//
// The choke point that LOGS the write lives in internal/notes
// (notes.WithStatusLogging); this is the seam that tells it who is calling. The
// two halves are separate on purpose: the decorator sees EVERY writer including
// one in a package that never heard of this file, and this side makes forgetting
// to identify yourself a compile-time impossibility rather than a review note.
//
// 🔴 THE LABEL IS A REQUIRED ARGUMENT, NOT A CONVENTION. setNoteStatus takes a
// statusWriter positionally, so a new call site cannot be written without
// naming one. The weaker design — stamp the context at each HTTP entry point and
// hope — is exactly the shape that produced the incident: at the time, two of the
// eight writers WERE native function tools with no route and no request log, so
// "whoever forgot" was invisible. Here the compiler asks. (⚠ Past tense, and the
// numbers have moved: upstream task #653 phase two deleted writerOperatorTool, so
// there are seven writers today and ONE of them is a native tool. The argument is
// unchanged; the arithmetic is not, which is why it is dated rather than restated
// as a standing fact.)
//
// Pair this with task_status_ledger_test.go, which pins that internal/api
// contains EXACTLY ONE call to Notes.SetStatus (inside setNoteStatus) and pins
// the set of setNoteStatus callers with the label each passes. A writer neither
// ledger has seen fails one of the two, whichever way it is written.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// statusWriter names the path performing a task-status write. It is a named
// type, not a bare string, so a caller cannot pass an arbitrary message and call
// it a writer identity.

	// Both call sites went with internal/api/operator.go, so internal/api now has
	// SEVEN status writers, not nine. Historic rows in the status log still carry
	// these two strings — a reader of `writer=` must not take their absence here as
	// evidence such a write never happened; it means no CURRENT code path produces
	// one. 🔴 DO NOT REUSE EITHER STRING for a new writer: an old row and a new row
	// would then be indistinguishable, which is the exact confusion this seam exists
	// to prevent.

// setNoteStatus is the ONE place in internal/api that calls Notes.SetStatus. It
// stamps writer onto the context so the store-side choke point can name the
// author of the write, then delegates unchanged.
//
// It adds NO behaviour: same note, same error, same everything. Callers keep
// their own validation, side effects and error mapping — this deliberately does
// not become a second place where status policy lives, because
// StatusAllowedForAgent (agents may not set `complete`) is a separate,
// deliberate rule that differs per caller and must not be flattened here.
//
// An empty writer is not silently accepted-as-fine: notes.WithWriter refuses to
// store it, so the write logs `writer=UNLABELLED` rather than an empty field.
//
// 🔴 BUT NOTHING IN THE TYPE SYSTEM STOPS A CALLER PASSING ONE. `statusWriter`
// is a defined string type, so `s.setNoteStatus(ctx, "", id, …)` compiles — this
// was measured, not assumed. The guard that catches it is
// TestEveryStatusWriterIsLabelled's caller ledger, not the compiler; see the
// UnlabelledWriter comment in internal/notes/statuslog.go, which used to claim
// the opposite and is now consistent with this.
