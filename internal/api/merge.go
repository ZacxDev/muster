// mergeCommentAuthor is the author stamped on both merge audit comments.
//
// 🔴 AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS COMMENT WAS FALSE, AND IT WAS BUILT ON. It said
// "a merge is only reachable from the SESSION UI (the human tapped it)" and "this
// route has no machine counterpart precisely so that stays true". At the time both
// were wrong on the LAN, because `requireSession` was a pass-through no-op, so the
// route answered uncredentialed LAN POSTs and any machine there could mint a
// `user`-authored merge comment. Measured then — no token, no cookie, no header:
//
//	curl -s -X POST http://<lan-nodeport>/tasks/merge -d 'winner=1&loser=1'  -> 400
//
// A 4xx from the handler's own validation means the handler RAN. That sentence was
// cited to decide against a machine merge route in the #366 decision record, on
// reasoning the code did not support; the audit caught it only after the record was
// written, committed and pushed. See upstream task #394.
//
// ⚠ THE EXPOSURE IS CLOSED; THE SCOPE CAVEAT IS NOT. requireSession now refuses a
// caller with no valid signed session cookie, so the curl above gets a 401 and
// "the human tapped it" is true again on both paths. What it is NOT is a claim
// about WHICH human: the tier is one shared operator password, so "user" means
// "whoever holds the operator session", not "a specific person". Nothing in the
// codebase branches on a comment's author (measured: no `Author == "user"` /
// `== "operator"` test outside tests; the UI and push paths only DISPLAY it), so
// this stays a human-read record rather than an authorization signal. Re-read
// #394 before the team instance lands, where "user" would have to mean a
// particular person and one shared password cannot supply that.

// handleTaskMerge handles POST /tasks/merge (session): merge two tasks by
// SUPERSEDE — the winner keeps working, the loser is closed with a pointer to it.
//
// 🔴 NOTHING IS DELETED. See the design note on notes.MergeTaskTags for why
// "absorb + delete the loser" was rejected: DELETE shares dismissTask and tears
// down the loser's live agent pod, agents.note_id is ON DELETE SET NULL with no
// way to re-point it, comments/attachments CASCADE, and the schema has no
// tombstone, so the loss would be silent and unrecoverable. Every effect below is
// additive and hand-reversible.
//
// Effects, in this exact order:
//  1. the winner gains the UNION of both tag sets (notes.AddTags — a single
//     statement, so a concurrent producer's tag is not lost),
//  2. the winner gains a comment naming what it absorbed,
//  3. the loser gains the tag `superseded-by:<winnerID>`,
//  4. the loser gains a comment naming what superseded it,
//  5. the loser's status becomes complete.
//
// 🔑 (3) IS THE MACHINE-READABLE HALF OF (4), and it comes FIRST inside the loser
// block on purpose. AddTags is idempotent; AddComment is not. So tag-then-comment
// makes a retry after a mid-sequence failure re-add the tag as a no-op, whereas
// comment-then-tag would duplicate the comment on every retry.
//
// 🔑 The LOSER IS MUTATED LAST, deliberately. The store interface has no
// transaction (the same accepted residual documented on the PATCH tag path), so a
// mid-sequence failure is possible. This ordering means a failure can leave the
// winner enriched but the loser still open — visibly un-merged, and re-runnable —
// rather than the loser closed while the winner never received its tags, which
// would silently retire work.
//
// Contract: 400 on a bad/absent id, on merging a task into itself, or on either
// tag guard (project conflict / tag cap) · 404 if either task is unknown · 409 if
// EITHER task is in progress (an agent is working the spec; the same wording and
// status the edit path uses) or if EITHER task is already complete (a repeat
// merge on the loser side, open work retired into a dead task on the winner side
// — each with its own wording) · 500 on a store failure. On success: 200 with an
// empty body and `HX-Trigger: tasks:changed`, which refetches #tasks-list
// (rendering the list here would drop the filter — this route has no `tag` query
// params).
//
// 🔴 That refetch carries the active filter ONLY because of tagScript's
// `htmx:configRequest` listener. This comment used to say the container
// "re-issues ITS OWN hx-get and the active tag filter survives" — FALSE, and it
// is the belief that shipped the paging defect: htmx 2.0.4 captures a verb path
// at process time and closes over it, so writing `hx-get` moves the ATTRIBUTE
// and not the request. `tasks:changed` is a trigger-driven refetch like any
// other. See internal/ui/components.go for the listener.

	// in the union, a re-run of a merge whose union was exactly MaxTags answers 400
	// naming a cap the operator never exceeded.

	// of the two, which is backwards.
	//
	// 🔴 THE CHECKED-500 IS SAFE HERE, AND THAT REQUIRED A MEASUREMENT, NOT AN
	// ASSUMPTION. notes.AddTags is NOT a validation boundary: it runs
	// NormalizeTags and nothing else (see its doc comment on PGStore), and
	// ValidateTags has exactly two callers — NormalizeAndValidate and
	// MergeTaskTags — neither on this path. So this write CANNOT fail on MaxTags
	// or on the project rule, and turning its error into a 500 therefore cannot
	// make a merge fail that succeeds today. It fires only on a real store failure,
	// which is what the sibling writes above already do.
	//
	// ⚠ The flip side, stated rather than hidden: because nothing caps it here,
	// this can push a loser that already carries MaxTags tags to MaxTags+1 (pinned
	// by TestTaskMergeStampsALoserAlreadyAtTheTagCap). That is not a new hazard — it
	// is one more instance of the residual AddTags already documents (two concurrent
	// adders can do the same) — and the affected task is one being retired. Skipping
	// the write near the cap was rejected: it would make the guarantee silently
	// conditional.
	//
	// 🔴 THE COST OF THAT IS WIDER THAN "a tags REPLACE is refused", which is what an
	// earlier draft of this comment claimed. MEASURED: the session edit modal
	// resubmits every field AND every chip, so `POST /tasks/{id}/edit` on an over-cap
	// task answers 400 "too many tags: 21 (max 20)" and the WHOLE form is refused —
	// title, body, model, repo, branch, privileges — naming a cap the operator never
	// exceeded. It is recoverable in-modal by removing a chip, and the task is
	// `complete` and therefore in the Done FILTER lane (it was the collapsed Done
	// section before the board flattened), which is why this is
	// accepted rather than blocking. Do not restate it as a tags-only refusal.
	//
	// ⚠ ALSO NOT ADDRESSED HERE, and named so it is not mistaken for closed: every
	// merge adds one permanent, count-1 entry to the tag VOCABULARY. TagVocabulary
	// has no status predicate and neither the filter chip row nor the edit-modal
	// datalist caps what it renders, so `superseded-by:<id>` accumulates in both for
	// the life of the task. Count-DESC ordering keeps it at the tail, so this
	// degrades slowly rather than breaking — but it is the unbounded-vocabulary shape
	// this codebase guards against elsewhere, and the Prometheus paragraph below
	// closes only the metrics half of it.
