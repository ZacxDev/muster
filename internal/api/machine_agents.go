// agentJSON is the machine-API projection of a provisioned agent. It is the ONE
// shape emitted by BOTH `GET /api/agents` and the `agent` key on a JSON task read
// (GET /api/tasks, GET /api/tasks/{id}), so a host tool learns a single schema and
// the two reads can never disagree about what an agent looks like.
//
// It is a DEDICATED DTO rather than agents.Agent or ui.AgentBrief, deliberately:
//
//   - agents.Agent tags `errorMessage` and `noteId` with `omitempty`. Those are
//     precisely the two values a monitor must see EXPLICITLY — `""` means "no
//     recorded reason", `null` means "not linked to a task" — and omitempty
//     deletes both keys, so a consumer cannot distinguish "absent because empty"
//     from "absent because this server is too old to send it". Every field below
//     is emitted unconditionally.
//   - ui.AgentBrief is a template view type with NO json tags at all (it would
//     marshal as `ID`/`Name`/`DisplayName`/`Status`) and carries only the four
//     fields a task card renders — it has no room for the liveness signal.
//
// 🔴 The two fields that had NO read path before this type existed:
//
//   - ErrorMessage is written by Provisioner.fail (provision.go) and by the
//     reconciler's stuck-in-provisioning backstop (reconcile.go). It was read by
//     nothing — it is the only record of WHY an agent went red, and it was
//     invisible outside `psql`.
//   - KickedOff is loaded into ui.AgentCardView and rendered by no template. It
//     separates "provisioned but the kickoff never landed" (false) from "the task
//     was delivered" (true) — the difference between a dead pod and a wedged run.

	ErrorMessage string `json:"errorMessage"`
	// KickoffError is the last kickoff SEND failure, or "" when none. NOT
	// omitempty, same reasoning as ErrorMessage.
	//
	// 🔴 It is the field that separates the two states `kickedOff: true` cannot:
	// an agent working on the message, and an agent whose gateway died holding it.
	// Live, `kickoff message for bold-moth failed: unexpected EOF` existed ONLY in
	// the muster pod's stdout, so the wire shape said `running` / `kickedOff:
	// true` / `errorMessage: ""` about an agent that had never cloned anything.
	KickoffError string `json:"kickoffError"`
	// KickoffAttempts is how many times the kickoff has been DELIVERED — 1 on a
	// normal dispatch, higher once the reconciler has recovered a lost one. A
	// value > 1 is the machine-readable signal that this agent's pod has been
	// dying underneath it.
	KickoffAttempts int `json:"kickoffAttempts"`
	// LastMessageAt is the created_at of the agent's most recent PERSISTED
	// transcript message, or null when it has never produced one. See the contract
	// note on LastActivityAt.
	LastMessageAt *time.Time `json:"lastMessageAt"`
	// LastActivityAt is the LIVENESS field: the newest durable event muster holds
	// for this agent — max(LastMessageAt, UpdatedAt). Never null, so a consumer can
	// always threshold on it.
	//
	// 🔴 WHY A STATUS FIELD IS NOT ENOUGH, and what this can and cannot detect.
	//
	// WHAT MAKES IT MOVE:
	//   - UpdatedAt moves on a status transition or a config write
	//     (UpdateStatus / SetModel / SetDisplayName / SetHooksToken / SetKickedOff).
	//     It does NOT move while an agent works: an agent that reaches `running`
	//     and then runs for hours has a frozen UpdatedAt, which is exactly how a
	//     wedged agent (status=running, kickedOff=true, pod Running, silent for
	//     four hours) passed every status-only health check.
	//   - LastMessageAt moves when a TURN COMPLETES and its transcript is
	//     persisted: the dispatch kickoff turn (provision.go), each web-chat turn,
	//     and each operator message/reply.
	//
	// HOW TO USE IT: for reference, two verified-healthy dispatched runs closed in
	// 138 s and 149 s. So `status == "running" && now - lastActivityAt > ~10m` is a
	// wedge candidate; `!kickedOff && now - lastActivityAt > 15m` is the
	// never-started case the reconciler is also meant to catch.
	//
	// WHAT IT CANNOT DETECT:
	//   - PROGRESS WITHIN A TURN. A transcript row is written when the turn
	//     RETURNS, not while it streams, so an agent 30 minutes into one long
	//     legitimate turn is indistinguishable here from an agent that died 30
	//     minutes ago. This errs toward FALSE ALARM, never toward false health.
	//   - WORK THAT PRODUCES NO GATEWAY TURN. Commits, file edits and shell work
	//     inside the pod are invisible to muster; only turns are persisted.
	//   - DEATH ITSELF. Nothing emits an event when a pod goes silent — staleness
	//     is inferred by the consumer, not reported by the server.
	//   - It is not a heartbeat and no heartbeat was invented for it: this is only
	//     the newest timestamp already in the database.
	//
	// One erosion to know about: the retention sweep
	// (DeleteChatMessagesOlderThan) can delete a long-idle agent's transcript, at
	// which point LastMessageAt goes back to null and LastActivityAt falls back to
	// UpdatedAt. The fallback keeps the field monotone in meaning ("newest thing we
	// still know about"), never null, and never newer than reality.

// drift's direction is the bad one: the machine read growing past the page.
//
// ⚠ THE DEFAULT IS DELIBERATELY WELL BELOW THE CEILING. The intended caller is an
// agent spending its context window on the answer, and a chat message is not a
// tweet: a tool_call row carries raw JSON arguments and a tool_result row carries
// dispatch output. 50 is a few screens of conversation; a caller that wants more
// asks for it and reads `hasMore` to learn whether it got everything.
//
// ⚠ THEY ARE EXPORTED FOR ONE REASON, THE SAME ONE ChiefApprovalMaxWait IS:
// muster states both numbers in its `--help` and applies the default itself, and
// this binary deliberately does not link the server package — so the relationship is
// pinned by a test that imports both (cmd/muster's
// TestTheAgentMessageLimitsMatchTheServers) rather than by a build edge. A help
// text quoting a bound the server no longer applies is the thing that rots.

// 🔴 THE GAP IT CLOSES, MEASURED AGAINST LIVE 0.8.42 BEFORE IT EXISTED: nothing
// holding a machine credential could read an agent's chat at all. GET
// /ui/agents/{name}/chat-log is wrapped in requireSession — the operator's signed-in
// browser — and answers 401 to the hook token, to X-Muster-Token and to no
// credential alike. The only machine GETs were /api/tmux/snapshot,
// /api/transcripts/{sessionId} and /api/agents, none of which carries a message. So
// `muster chief ask` could post a message and print ONE reply, and nothing
// could read the conversation afterwards — not even the agent's own past replies.
// The remaining ways to read it were the operator's browser and a SELECT against
// chat_messages, which is a backdoor rather than an interface.
//
// 🔴 requireHookOrServiceToken, THE SAME WRAPPER GET /api/transcripts/{sessionId}
// USES, AND THAT PRECEDENT IS THE ARGUMENT RATHER THAN A CONVENIENCE. A transcript
// tail is Claude Code's own record of a session: tool INPUTS, i.e. file paths, bash
// command lines and edit bodies, plus tool RESULTS, i.e. file contents and command
// output. Chat is what a human typed to an agent and what it typed back. The
// transcript route is strictly the more sensitive of the two and it is already on
// this tier, so this is a route joining an existing trust boundary rather than a
// widening of one. It is written down in cmd/muster's agentRowRoutes with that
// reason, because the set of routes on this wrapper is the thing that must never
// grow quietly.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THAT TIER COSTS, STATED THE WAY transcripts.go STATES IT: the wrapper is
// ENFORCE-WHEN-SET. On a server with no MUSTER_HOOK_TOKEN it serves this to anyone
// who can reach the LAN NodePort. The deployed server sets one.
//
// 🔴 THERE IS NO AGENT HALF, AND THE SENTENCE THAT USED TO SIT HERE CLAIMING ONE
// WAS UNARMED IS THE REASON. It read "the agent half is unarmed in production (no
// MUSTER_CHIEF_TOKEN), so today the shared secret is the only live path" — and
// measured against the live cluster, the door had been ARMED since the previous
// day, a matching agent pod was Running, and that pod's credential had
// already been seen resolving through this tier. The route is now requireHookToken:
// the shared secret, and nothing else. See the registration in agents.go for the
// full measurement and for why self-scoping was not the fix chosen.
//
// ⚠ IT NEVER CREATES A SESSION. resolveSessions/LatestOrCreateSession — what every
// browser path uses — creates one for an agent that has none, which is right for a
// page that is about to be typed into and wrong for a read: an agent that has never
// been spoken to would acquire an empty session as a side effect of being monitored.
// This resolves read-only and answers `sessionId: 0` with an empty list instead.

// held here would be invisible from `agent messages` and from the agent's detail
// page. That relationship is asserted, not assumed:
// TestTheMachineAgentMessageWriteSteersIntoTheSessionTheReadReturns posts here and
// reads it back over the GET.
//
// 🔴 requireArmedHookToken — THE SHARED SECRET, NOT THE AGENT TIER, AND FAIL-CLOSED
// RATHER THAN ENFORCE-WHEN-SET. The credential choice is the reason the READ is on
// it: the handler keys on an arbitrary {name} with NO self-scoping, so on the wider
// tier one admitted pod could steer EVERY other agent. A write is strictly worse
// than the read that argument was made about. The caller this exists for is
// `chief ask`, run from the operator's own host, which holds the shared secret
// already.
//
// ⚠ THE ARMING HALF IS A SEPARATE CLAIM AND IT IS THE ONE THE ROUND-1 AUDIT FORCED.
// Every other requireHookToken route serves OPEN when MUSTER_HOOK_TOKEN is unset;
// this one answers 503. The route it re-homed off (requireOperatorToken) demanded a
// bearer unconditionally, so inheriting the open default would have turned a
// fail-CLOSED agent-steering write into a fail-OPEN one as a side effect of moving
// it. It also concedes what the tier comparison above does not: the credential to
// steer an agent went from the reserved operator's in-cluster uuid — held by one pod
// — to a shared secret that names no caller and travels in cleartext to the LAN
// NodePort many times a day. Full argument at the registration site
// (registerAgentRoutes) and on the wrapper (requireArmedHookToken).
//
// ⚠ IT USES Gateway.Chat, NOT chatTurn: the operator route it replaces ran a
// plain (tool-less) turn, and this change re-homes a path rather than widening
// what the agent can do while answering on it.
//
// 🔴 THIS IS THE ROUTE THE EMPTY-REPLY DEFECT WAS MEASURED ON, AND THE READING IT
// PRODUCES IS WORTH KNOWING: three consecutive turns against a live agent answered
// HTTP 200 with `{"reply":""}` in under three seconds each, because the model was a
// reasoning model and the tool-less turn ran over streaming chat-completions, which
// drops every content delta for that model class. Gateway.Chat runs over
// /v1/responses now; the measurement and the controls are on its doc. Note what this
// handler does with an empty reply — it writes NO assistant message and still
// answers 200 — so the only trace of such a turn is a user message with no answer
// beside it in the transcript.
