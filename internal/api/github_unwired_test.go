// A nil Extensions.GitHub MUST RENDER, NOT DEREFERENCE.
//
// 🔴 THE FAILURE THIS FILE IS WRITTEN AGAINST, READ OFF A RUNNING DEPLOYMENT.
// The GitHub connection store is built only when an encryption key is set, so
// the shipping default has Extensions.GitHub == nil — and handleReposContent's
// first statement was a method call on it. The recovered panic answered 500 with
// a ZERO-LENGTH body, so the Repos tab rendered an empty rectangle: no error, no
// empty state, nothing to read.
//
// 🔴 AND THE BLAST RADIUS WAS THE WHOLE APPLICATION, WHICH IS THE PART A READER
// WOULD NOT GUESS FROM THE ROUTE NAME. The shell mounts the Repos panel on every
// page with hx-trigger="load", so EVERY navigation fetched this route and every
// navigation raised a request-failed toast. It had gone unobserved because
// nothing had ever opened the tab.
//
// ⚠ IT IS NOT A REGRESSION AND THERE IS NO CHANGE TO BISECT TO. The route was
// registered unconditionally from the day it was written, which is a deliberate
// property of this package (see routes.go), and the handler has never had the
// branch that property requires. What makes registration-without-branching sound
// is EVERY handler answering its own unwired case, and three of the four here
// did not.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// unwiredGitHubServer is a server with a real operator credential and NO GitHub
// extension at all — the shape cmd/muster-server builds without an encryption
// key, which is its default.
//
// 🔴 THE FIXTURE MUST BE A nil STORE, NOT A CONFIGURED ONE. A fixture that wires
// any store — even one whose every method returns an error — exercises a
// different branch and cannot see the dereference this file exists for.
// Extensions is left at its zero value so nothing can be wired by accident.
