// handleChiefPanel serves GET /ui/chief/panel: the chief slide-out's body.
//
// 🔴 IT RE-MOUNTS THE EXISTING AGENT CHAT RATHER THAN BUILDING A SECOND ONE.
// The view it renders is the SAME ui.AgentDetailView handleAgentDetail builds,
// so the panel's #chat-log is fed by the same GET /ui/agents/{name}/chat-log on
// the same `sse:chat.reply`, and its #chat-form opens the same WebSocket. A
// second chat surface would mean a second transcript, a second unread ledger and
// a second place for a streaming bug to live — and the session drawer, the
// markdown pass and the kickoff-stream reveal would all have to be re-derived.
//
// 🔴 EVERY FAILURE HERE RENDERS AS PROSE, NOT AS AN HTTP ERROR. This partial is
// swapped into a panel the operator just opened; a 500 would leave them looking
// at whatever htmx does with an error body, which on this page is nothing at
// all. "No agent carries the chief display name" is a configuration statement a
// reader can act on, and it is the honest answer in every deployment that has
// not dispatched a chief yet.

// 🔴 IT IS A FUNCTION RATHER THAN A HANDLER BECAUSE A SECOND ROUTE ANSWERS WITH
// THIS EXACT PARTIAL. handleAgentSessionCreate's panel branch must return the
// panel body on the NEW session, and a panel that got its body from two renderers
// would be two panels: one of them would miss the out-of-band launcher slot, or the
// active-session mark the memory is keyed on, or the surface that routes around the
// containing-block hazard — and it would miss it silently, on one path only.

// must know which agent it is writing to BEFORE it writes (see
// handleAgentSessionCreate's panel branch), and re-resolving here would give the
// write and the render two independent answers: a display-name move landing between
// them would create the thread on one agent and draw the other's panel — the same
// wrong-agent split, in a narrower window. One resolution, one subject.
