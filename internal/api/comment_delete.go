// Task-comment retraction (migration 0021). Lives in its own file rather than in
// notes.go so it does not collide with concurrent work in that file or in
// server.go's retention region.
//
// 🔴 WHY SOFT. A comment thread is where a task's investigation lives — the same
// argument migration 0019 made for the task row itself. A hard DELETE of a
// comment is unrecoverable inside the daily-backup window (the CronJob runs
// 04:30, so a comment posted and retracted the same day is in NO snapshot), and
// the thing being retracted is usually a mistake worth being able to look at
// again. The row stays; only its visibility goes.

// errCommentTaskNotFound distinguishes "the TASK does not exist (or is
// dismissed)" from "the COMMENT does not exist", so each caller can render the
// right 404 body. pgx.ErrNoRows out of softDeleteTaskComment always means the
// COMMENT.
var errCommentTaskNotFound = errors.New("task not found")

// softDeleteTaskComment is the shared core behind BOTH retraction paths — the
// machine DELETE /api/tasks/{id}/comments/{cid} and the session/UI
// DELETE /tasks/{id}/comments/{cid} — so the two can never diverge on scoping,
// side-effects, or which id a 404 refers to.
//
// The parent Get probe is load-bearing for the SAME reason it is on
// handleAPITaskDelete: it is what makes "unknown task" a 404 rather than the
// comment-shaped 404 the store's ErrNoRows would otherwise produce, and it is
// what refuses a retraction against a dismissed task.
//
// It returns errCommentTaskNotFound (caller → 404 "task not found"),
// pgx.ErrNoRows (caller → 404 "comment not found": unknown comment id, a comment
// belonging to a different task, or one already retracted), or any other store
// error (caller → 500).

// handleAPITaskCommentDelete handles DELETE /api/tasks/{id}/comments/{cid}
// (machine, hook-token-gated): retract one comment from a task's thread.
//
// ROUTE SHAPE. It is the DELETE twin of POST /api/tasks/{id}/comments, which is
// the only existing comment route — a comment is addressed as a child of its task
// everywhere else in this API (POST /api/tasks/{id}/comments, GET
// /tasks/{id}/attachments/{aid}), and nothing addresses a comment by a bare
// global id. A flat /api/comments/{cid} would have been a second addressing
// convention AND would drop the task scope that makes a mistyped id a 404 instead
// of a hit on someone else's thread.
//
// 🔴 AUTH. requireHookToken, NOT requireSession — because the CALLER is a
// machine. This is the route an external producer (repo-cos, the drafter, CI, a
// CC session) uses to retract what it posted, and none of them can complete a
// browser login to get a session cookie. The session-tier twin below
// (handleNoteCommentDelete) is the human spelling of the same operation.
//
// ⚠ requireHookToken is ENFORCE-WHEN-SET (an empty MUSTER_HOOK_TOKEN leaves it
// open, with a startup warning) — that is the pre-existing, app-wide property of
// every machine endpoint and is deliberately not special-cased here. So on a
// server with no hook token this route IS the weaker of the two, which is the
// opposite of what it was when requireSession authenticated nobody.
//
// 🔴 STATUS CODES, PINNED (mirroring DELETE /api/tasks/{id}): bad task or comment
// id → 400; unknown or dismissed task → 404 "task not found"; unknown comment,
// a comment on a different task, or an ALREADY-retracted comment → 404 "comment
// not found" (idempotent-by-404, exactly as a repeat task delete answers); store
// failure → 500; no/bad hook token → 401 (middleware). Always JSON — never the
// htmx card fragment the session route returns.

// handleNoteCommentDelete handles DELETE /tasks/{id}/comments/{cid} (session):
// the UI path behind the per-comment trash control, re-rendering the single card
// so the retracted comment disappears in place.
//
// 🔴 IT IS THE SESSION-TIER TWIN OF THE HOOK-TOKEN ROUTE ABOVE, and that is a
// deliberate, flagged trade-off — the SAME pairing DELETE /tasks/{id} (session)
// and DELETE /api/tasks/{id} (hook token) have had since the machine route was
// added. The reason it exists is that the browser carries no BEARER token: a
// signed-in operator presents a session cookie, and the only way a card button
// could satisfy requireHookToken is for the server to render
// MUSTER_HOOK_TOKEN into the page — handing the token that guards /api/send
// and all of /api/tasks* to any XSS, and to a document that signing out cannot
// revoke. That is strictly worse than this route.
//
// ⚠ WHAT CHANGED, AND WHAT DID NOT. This route is no longer reachable without
// credentials: requireSession refuses a caller with no valid signed cookie, so
// the trade-off is now "a signed-in operator may retract a comment" rather than
// "anyone on the LAN may". The TIER argument above is unaffected — the browser
// still has no hook token, and rendering one is still the worse option. If the
// operator would rather have no UI control at all, delete this handler and its
// one registration in server.go; the machine route is unaffected.
//
// Bad task or comment id → 400; unknown/dismissed task or unknown/already-
// retracted comment → 404 (the session path does not distinguish the two — it
// renders no body); store failure → 500; otherwise the re-rendered card.
