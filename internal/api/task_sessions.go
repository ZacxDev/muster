// Task threads (migration 0023): every task-scoped machine call carrying an
// X-Muster-Session-Id joins that session to the task's thread, so "which
// sessions worked task #N" is a query instead of prose in a comment body.
//
// 🔴 THE DETECTOR IS STRUCTURAL, NOT TEXTUAL. Nothing here — or anywhere else —
// scans a comment body or a transcript tail for "#123". A link exists because a
// session made a request against that task's route while identifying itself, which
// is a fact about the request, not an interpretation of prose. A regex over
// comment text would gain links from a session merely QUOTING another task's
// number, lose every link whose phrasing changed, and be silently wrong in both
// directions.

// maxSessionHostLen caps the optional X-Muster-Host header. Like
// maxSessionIDLen it is an attacker-influenceable header on any hook-token call,
// and it lands in a stored column; a hostname is well under this.
const maxSessionHostLen = 128

// taskSessionHost reads the OPTIONAL X-Muster-Host header (rune-capped, so a
// multibyte hostname can never be truncated into invalid UTF-8 that Postgres
// rejects on write). Absent ⇒ "" ⇒ the column keeps whatever an earlier touch
// recorded.

// linkTaskSession joins the request's session to noteID's thread with the given
// role, returning whether anything OBSERVABLE changed (a new link, or a role
// upgrade — never a bare last_seen_at touch).
//
// It is a NO-OP with no error when the request carries no session id: the vast
// majority of machine calls (repo-cos, the drafter, CI) are not Claude Code
// sessions and must not be forced to invent an identity. The scope is deliberately
// the cc_sessions TEXT id space only — dispatched devpod agents keep their existing
// `Task #N` badge and are NOT folded into this table.
//
// A dismissed or unknown task answers pgx.ErrNoRows, which is swallowed here: every
// caller either probes the task itself (and answers its own 404) or is about to,
// and a link failure must never be the thing that decides an HTTP status for a task
// that does not exist.
//
// The project/cwd enrichment is read from cc_sessions ONCE, here, and then STORED
// on the link row — it is not a join at read time. That is the whole retention
// story: cc_sessions is swept at 14 days, so a link that borrowed its context live
// would go blank exactly when the thread became the only surviving record. Nil-safe
// (no Suggest store ⇒ empty context, and the link still records).

	// fields read below are the only ones this enrichment wants, and suggest.SessionMeta
	// carries both. GetSession would detoast and ship the session's transcript tail as
	// well: measured on the upstream Postgres, 506 rows, 248 MB of tail,
	// AVERAGE 502 kB — a half-megabyte read per task-session link POST to fill two short
	// strings. A projection that exists and is not called is not a fix, which is how this
	// call site survived the round that introduced it.
	//
	// 🔴 THIS ONE LOOKUP NOW ANSWERS TWO QUESTIONS, AND THE SECOND IS THE NEW ONE.
	// `ok` — does a transcript record for this session exist right now — is what
	// internal/notes used to probe for itself in SQL and may not any more (plan
	// §2.2): it is the input to the STORED, MONOTONIC detail_seen column, which is
	// the bit that separates "transcript expired" from "no transcript recorded" in
	// the UI. It is read here, from the store that owns it, and PASSED DOWN.
	//
	// 🔴 SO `ok` IS TAKEN WHETHER OR NOT THE ROW EXISTS — the old `err == nil && ok`
	// guard covered the whole statement and would have thrown the absence away. The
	// project/cwd copy still only happens on a hit; a miss must not blank a context
	// an earlier touch recorded.
	//
	// A FAILED lookup leaves detailSeen false, which is safe in this direction and
	// only this direction: the store ORs it into the column, so a false teaches the
	// row nothing and can never reset a true. (The READ path has no such luxury —
	// see withSessionLiveness, where a failed probe is an error rather than a false.)

// noteTaskSession is the handler-side wrapper. It links and reports only whether

//
// 🔴 THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO FAILURE RETURN. This replaces a
// `linkTaskSessionOrFail` that answered 409 when the per-task session cap was hit,
// which produced two measured defects: PATCH …/status applied the status change and
// THEN 409'd (the caller told it failed about a request that had succeeded), and a
// plain GET answered 409 forever once fifty sessions had read a task. A provenance
// breadcrumb must never break the operation it is annotating, so no outcome here
// can fail a request.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS ACTUALLY COUNTED, stated precisely because the counter is read as a
// completeness signal. Exactly TWO outcomes reach this function's error branch and
// increment muster_task_session_links_skipped_total:
//
//	thread_full — the cap had nothing evictable, so a `read` breadcrumb was dropped
//	error       — a store failure
//
// A DISMISSED or UNKNOWN task is NOT among them. linkTaskSession swallows
// pgx.ErrNoRows itself and returns (false, nil) — see its own comment for why: the
// caller either probes the task or is about to, and a link failure must not decide
// the HTTP status for a task that does not exist. So that case is neither logged
// nor counted here, and the counter is a measure of links lost DESPITE a live task,
// not of every link not written. An earlier version of this comment listed the
// dismissed case as counted, which would have made anyone auditing the counter
// believe it covered more than it does.
