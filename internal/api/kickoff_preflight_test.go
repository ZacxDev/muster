// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SYNCHRONOUS REFUSAL, AND THE TWO OPERATIONS IT MUST NOT TOUCH.
//
// 🔴 WHY A PRE-FLIGHT EXISTS AT ALL. Provisioner.Dispatch refuses a kickoff it
// cannot deliver, but createAndDispatchAgent calls it inside safeGo — after the row
// has been created and after this handler has answered — so the refusal reached this
// pod's log and a status colour, and the POST answered 200 over it. The pre-flight
// asks the same question BEFORE the row exists, so the person who clicked is told.
//
// 🔴 AND THE REASON IT NEEDS A TEST OF ITS OWN IS THE SHAPE OF ITS FAILURE. It is
// one `if` in a handler: wrong, it refuses operations that work, and the loudest of
// those is the very escape route the refusal's own text recommends. "Save for later"
// and Start are the two, and a guard that only asserted the refusal would be
// satisfied by a handler that refused all three.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// preflightProvisioner is a Provisioner that reports a fixed deliverability answer
// and records which lifecycle methods were reached.
//
// ⚠ IT EMBEDS stubProvisioner so the methods this test does not drive answer
// harmlessly, and OVERRIDES the three it does. The embedded
// KickoffUndeliverableReason returns "" (deliverable); this type's own is what makes
// the refusal case expressible.
