// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THREAD SEARCH FOR THE CHIEF PANEL
//
// 🔴 OPERATOR-ONLY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SECURITY STATEMENT OF THIS FILE. The
// response carries MESSAGE CONTENT — a snippet cut out of a chat_messages body —
// which is the exact sensitivity a neighbouring PR is being held over. So it is
// registered behind requireSession (a signed operator session cookie) and behind
// NOTHING ELSE: not the shared hook token, not a per-agent hooks token. The two
// non-operator credentials that reach other routes in this package must get a
// 401 here, and api.TestChiefThreadSearchIsOperatorOnly asserts both of them.
//
// 🔴 IT SEARCHES kind='text' ONLY. Store.SearchSessions carries the reason at
// length; the short version is that tool_result rows are file contents and
// command output, so including them would make every query match noise AND would
// paste raw file bytes on screen as a snippet.
//
// ⚠ IT IS SCOPED TO THE CHIEF'S OWN THREADS. The panel talks to one agent, so the
// search takes that agent's id and no caller can widen it — a route keyed on an
// arbitrary agent is what got GET /api/agents/{name}/messages narrowed.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// handleChiefThreadSearch serves GET /ui/chief/threads/search: the thread ROWS
// matching ?q=, or the plain recent list when q is blank.
//
// 🔴 A BLANK QUERY RENDERS THE RECENT LIST RATHER THAN AN EMPTY RESULT SET. The
// search input swaps this partial OVER the list, so "cleared the box" and "typed
// something that matches nothing" are the same request shape from the client's
// point of view — and answering the first with "No thread matches that." would
// leave the operator unable to get their list back without closing the panel.

	// 🔴 EVERY FAILURE RENDERS AS ROWS, NEVER AS AN HTTP ERROR — the same rule the
	// panel body obeys, and for the same reason: this partial is swapped into a
	// view the operator is looking at, and htmx does not swap a non-2xx body, so a
	// 500 leaves the previous matches on screen as though they were the answer.
	//
	// 🔴 BUT A FAILURE IS SAID TO BE A FAILURE, AND IT DID NOT USED TO BE. Every path
	// below rendered "No thread matches that." — a Postgres error (a NUL byte in `q`
	// is enough), a chief that has gone missing, and a genuinely empty result set were
	// ONE SENTENCE, distinguishable only in a server log the operator never reads. The
	// 200 is the right call and it is kept; what changes is that the honest answer to
	// "did my query miss?" is now on screen. ui.ChiefThreadsView.Failed carries it and
	// the rendered container names the state in an attribute, so the guard asserts the
	// STATE rather than the words.
	failed := func() { write(ui.ChiefThreadsView{Query: q, Failed: true}) }

	// 🔴 A NO-DATABASE BOOT IS NOT A READ THAT MIGHT WORK NEXT TIME, AND THE DEFAULT
	// FAILURE SENTENCE ENDS "Try again." There is no store to ask, so a retry cannot
	// succeed — now or ever — and the instruction can only waste the operator's time.
	// The STATE stays `error` (it is still the absence of an answer, which is what
	// distinguishes it from `empty`); only the sentence is replaced. It matches
	// writeChiefPanelBody's own no-database reason, because it is the same fact about
	// the same deployment.
	//
	// ⚠ REACHABLE ONLY BY HITTING THIS ROUTE DIRECTLY. A no-database panel renders the
	// configuration statement and no search box at all, so nothing on screen asks this
	// question — which is exactly why the wrong sentence sat here unnoticed.

		// panel OPEN, where naming the missing display name is an instruction a reader
		// can act on. This route answers a keystroke inside a panel that has ALREADY
		// resolved a chief and drawn a search box; "no thread matches that" would be a
