// Package sse implements a small Server-Sent Events broadcaster: subscribers
// register a channel, the broadcaster fans an Event out to every subscriber,
// and subscribers unregister when done.
//
// The broadcaster is transport-agnostic — it only deals in Event values and
// channels. The HTTP handler that writes the SSE wire format lives in the api
// package and uses Subscribe/Unsubscribe.

// Event is a single broadcast message. Name maps to the SSE "event:" field
// and Data to the "data:" field (already-serialized, typically JSON).
type Event struct {
	Name string
	Data string
}

// ValidData reports whether s may be used as an Event's Data without breaking
// the SSE frame it will be written into.
//
// 🔴 A NEWLINE IN Data IS NOT A COSMETIC PROBLEM — IT IS FRAME INJECTION, AND IT
// WALKS ANY ALLOWLIST APPLIED TO Name. The api package writes one frame as
//
//	fmt.Fprintf(w, "event: %s\ndata: %s\n\n", ev.Name, ev.Data)
//
// so a Data carrying "\n\nevent: request.resolved\ndata: {}" terminates that frame
// early and emits a SECOND, fully-formed event under a name the caller never had
// to be allowed to send. A carriage return is refused for the same reason — the SSE
// spec treats CR, LF and CRLF alike as line terminators, so "\r" alone ends the line
// in a conforming client while a check that only looked for "\n" read it as
// harmless.
//
// ⚠ IT IS SUFFICIENT AGAINST THAT HAZARD BUT NOT NECESSARY, AND AN EARLIER VERSION
// OF THIS COMMENT OVERSTATED IT. It said an allowlist on Name "is only as strong as
// this check" and that "without it the name field is a suggestion". Measured for
// #871's round 0 and that is wrong wherever the caller ALSO requires Data to be
// valid JSON: forging needs the bare token `event` at the start of a line, and in
// JSON a raw CR/LF is legal only as whitespace between tokens while no JSON token
// spells `event` — so no forging payload is ever valid JSON. The one caller that
// takes untrusted Data (api.handleEventPublish) applies both, and its header records
// the measurement. What this predicate uniquely catches there is valid JSON with a
// raw newline BETWEEN tokens, which truncates the data field but cannot change the
// event name. Keep it — it is two characters of ContainsAny and it holds even if a
// caller relaxes its JSON contract — but do not quote it as the only thing standing
// between an allowlist and a forged event.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A CHECK ON CALLER-SUPPLIED Data, NOT A NEW INVARIANT. Every in-process
// broadcast in this repo already satisfies it by construction, because each one
// passes the output of encoding/json — which escapes both characters inside string
// values and emits neither between tokens. The one path where Data does NOT come
// from a marshaller is an HTTP route that lets another process publish; that is
// the caller this function exists for.
//
// ⚠ IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ENFORCED INSIDE Broadcast. Broadcast has no way to
// report a refusal — it returns nothing and is called from background goroutines —
// so enforcing there would mean silently dropping an event, which is the failure
// mode this package's own "drop rather than block" comment already warns is
// invisible. The predicate lives here, next to the format it protects, and the one
// caller that can receive untrusted Data applies it and answers 400.
