// Package metrics holds muster's Prometheus instrumentation. Everything here is
// registered on the default registry and exposed at /metrics.
//
// 🔴 THIS IS A SUBSET OF THE PACKAGE IT WAS CARVED FROM, AND THE OMISSIONS ARE
// THE POINT. The project muster was extracted from instrumented both products
// out of one file: permission decisions, Web Push delivery, auto-approve
// windows, the attention queue, suggestion generation and a transcript archive
// — none of which muster owns. Copying them would have shipped counters that
// can only ever read zero, and a metric that is structurally incapable of
// moving is worse than a missing one: it reads on a dashboard as "this
// subsystem is quiet" rather than "this subsystem is not here". Those metrics
// stayed with the routing service. If muster later grows one of those concerns,
// the counter arrives with it.
//
// 🔴 CARDINALITY RULE, APPLIED THROUGHOUT: every label below is drawn from a
// CLOSED Go vocabulary. No identifier that a producer can mint — a session id,
// a task id, an agent name, a free-form tag value, a raw request path — may
// ever become a label. Each one is an unbounded series and a leak of somebody
// else's identifier into a metrics store that is usually less protected than
// the database. Where that rule is easy to break by accident, the declaration
// says so at its own site.
