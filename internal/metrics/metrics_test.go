// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE METRIC LEDGER.
//
// 🔴 THESE ARE INVARIANT GUARDS, NOT REGRESSION COVERAGE, and the label matters.
// No bug was ever observed in this file; what was observed, on the project this
// package was carved out of, is that instrumentation accretes — a counter here,
// a label there — and the two properties that matter are exactly the two nobody
// checks at the moment they add one:
//
//  1. the metric NAMESPACE. A metric named for the wrong service lands in the
//     same Prometheus as the other one's, under a name that looks like it, and
//     the confusion surfaces on a dashboard months later.
//  2. the LABEL SETS. Every label here is supposed to be drawn from a closed Go
//     vocabulary. A label whose values a producer can mint — a session id, an
//     agent name, a tag value — is one new time series per value, and nothing
//     at the call site says so.
//
// Both are ledgers: they fail when the set GROWS *or* SHRINKS, so a metric
// appearing without a decision reddens as loudly as one going missing.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THEY DO NOT SEE, stated so the name cannot be read as wider than the
// body: nothing here checks that the values PASSED to a label are bounded. A
// call site that writes a session id into `role` produces a metric with the
// right name, the right label and unbounded cardinality, and these tests are
// blind to it. That is the caller's discipline; these guards only pin the
// SHAPE.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// wantMetrics is every metric this package registers, with its label names.
//
// A histogram or counter with no labels has an empty slice — distinct from a
// missing entry, which is the failure.
