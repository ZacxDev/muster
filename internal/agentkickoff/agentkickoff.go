// Package agentkickoff DELIVERS an agent's first turn: it hands the note a
// dispatch was created with (agents.Agent.PendingNote) to the agent's model
// gateway once the agent's instance is ready, and records what happened on the row.
//
// 🔴 IT IS A BACKGROUND RECONCILE LOOP, NOT A STEP IN THE DISPATCH REQUEST, AND
// THE CODE THAT ALREADY EXISTED DECIDED THAT. agents.DecideReconcile is a
// per-tick decision table over (row, live instance, now): "a ready instance whose
// kickoff was never sent → retry while young, error once it has dwelt past
// ProvisioningStuckTimeout". That is the shape of a loop, and the alternatives are
// worse on their own terms:
//
//   - Dispatch runs inside a handler goroutine with a 5-minute operation budget
//     (agentprovision.DefaultOpTimeout) and returns when the Deployment is APPLIED,
//     not when the pod is ready. Delivering there means either blocking that
//     goroutine on image pull + repository clone + runtime boot, or giving up on a
//     slow-but-healthy pod. A loop simply looks again next tick.
//   - A first turn that fails BEFORE it is sent (no instance yet, no token) is
//     retried by the loop for free, and the table's dwell bound is what eventually
//     turns "never delivered" into a visible `error` — a mechanism a request-scoped
//     call has no equivalent of.
//   - Start of a saved agent owes the same first turn (agentprovision.Adapter.Start
//     says so) and has no request that waits for readiness either. One deliverer
//     serves both doors.
//
// 🔴 SINGLE-FLIGHT IS THE PER-AGENT CLAIM, NOT A LEADER LEASE. Two replicas
// ticking against one database both see `ready && !KickedOff`; each must win
// agents.Store.ClaimKickoff (a conditional UPDATE — a compare-and-set on the row)
// before doing anything, and the winner RE-READS the row under the claim, so a
// replica that lost the race or arrived after a delivery does nothing. No lease is
// needed and none exists in this module.
//
// 🔴 KickedOff IS STAMPED *BEFORE* THE MODEL TURN, SO A PAID TURN IS NEVER RUN
// TWICE. Once the stamp lands, agents.DecideReconcile stops returning
// ActionRetryKickoff for the row and this package never touches it again — even if
// the turn then fails, times out, or this process dies mid-turn. The cost is the
// mirror image and it is accepted: a turn that fails AFTER the stamp is recorded in
// agents.kickoff_error and is NOT retried automatically. Everything muster can check
// without opening a connection to the agent runtime — the token, the claim, a chat
// session, and the agent's address and credential (agentgateway.Gateway.Resolve,
// which for the k8s driver reads the Deployment from the Kubernetes API) — is checked
// before the stamp, and a failure there is retried.
//
// ⚠ ONE FAILURE THAT COSTS NOTHING STILL LANDS AFTER THE STAMP: a connection to the
// runtime that cannot be OPENED (DNS, refused). It happens inside the send, so it is
// recorded, as agents.KickoffNeverConnectedReason, and not retried. Retrying it would
// mean un-stamping a row that RecordKickoffDelivery has already counted as an
// attempt — a second write after the point of no return, and the kicked_off=f with
// attempts>0 state that round 0 deleted a guard for because no writer produced it.
// What the record buys instead is a remedy that says re-sending is safe
// (agents.KickoffResendSafe), which is true for this cause and for the next one.
//
// ⚠ AND ONE IS RE-SENT IN PLACE: a typed `not_ready` (ccd, before the Claude Code
// CLI is at its prompt — answered before anything is pasted). deliver re-sends it
// within the same delivery, under the same stamp, for a bounded wait; one that
// outlasts the bound is recorded as agents.KickoffNotAcceptedReason, also
// resend-safe. Nothing is un-stamped.
//
// 🔴 AND THAT UNRETRIED FAILURE IS VISIBLE, NOT JUST RECORDED (an operator
// decision). The stamp clears the "kickoff owed" badge, so before this a failed
// turn left a card reading healthy with the failure only in a column no page
// showed. agents.KickoffFailed (kicked_off AND kickoff_error set) now drives a
// "kickoff failed" badge carrying the error text and a remedy, and `kickoffFailed`
// on GET /api/agents. The remedy says re-sending by hand is safe only when nothing
// was sent (agents.KickoffResendSafe); for every other cause it says to check
// whether the agent is already working first, because the runtime may still be
// running the turn. A turn cut off by THIS process shutting down is recorded as such
// ([ShutdownCancelledReason]), and the server's shutdown waits for that record
// ([Deliverer.Done]) before it closes the pool. Each of these changes calls
// [Config.OnChange], so an open Agents list re-renders.
//
// 🔴 IT ACTS ONLY ON ROWS THIS DEPLOYMENT OWNS, AND NEVER ON A KICKED-OFF ROW. The
// agents table can hold rows another system wrote (a namespace the configured
// prefix did not produce); escalating those to `error` would be this process
// asserting a verdict about pods it cannot see. And a kicked-off row's recovery
// (agents.ActionResendKickoff / ActionErrorKickoffLost) is a re-delivery decision
// this package deliberately does not take — see [owesFirstTurn].
//
// 🔴 AN EMPTY REPLY IS A FAILED DELIVERY. The agent runtime's /v1/responses is
// known to discard its own successful retry for reasoning models and answer 200
// with no text; recording that as delivered would report an agent that was told
// its task when nothing says it was. It lands in agents.kickoff_error.

//
// 🔴 WHY THAT PROVES NOTHING WAS SENT. A dial error comes only from opening a NEW

// request on a new connection after a failure on a reused one only when nothing was
// written or the request is replayable, which a POST without an Idempotency-Key is
// not (net/http's shouldRetryRequest). A timeout or cancellation that interrupts a
// dial can surface without the OpError, as a bare context error; that is recorded as
// a timeout or shutdown, which errs toward "check before re-sending".

// The failure most worth recording — a turn cut off by shutdown — is the one whose
// ctx is already cancelled, so a write on it would be refused by the driver before
// it left the process and the failure would vanish. Pinned by
// TestAShutdownCancelledTurnIsRecordedAsSuch, whose fake store refuses a write on a
// done ctx exactly as pgx does.
