// The generator half of the agent-name tombstone: a destroyed agent's name must
// never be handed to a new agent.
//
// 🔴 WHY THESE ARE POSTGRES-BACKED AND NOT FAKE-STORE TESTS. The whole change
// lives in the SQL — PGStore.NameExists's second EXISTS and migration 0002's
// AFTER DELETE trigger. A fake store decides for itself what NameExists returns,
// so a fake-store version of the assertion below is GREEN against the broken
// code: it would be testing the test's own stub. The only fixture that can tell
// the fix from its absence is a real database that really deletes a row.
//
// 🔴 AND THE POOL IS NARROWED TO A SINGLE NAME SO THE ASSERTION IS REACHED. With
// the real 16x16 pool, "BuildUniqueAgentName did not return the retired name" is
// a 255/256 coin flip per draw and 10 draws make it a near-certainty — the test
// would pass against the bug ~96% of the time and record a KILL for the wrong
// reason under mutation. The word lists are package-level vars, so narrowing
// them to one adjective and one noun makes the generator's output the retired
// name or nothing — and the control assertion on generateName() proves the
// narrowing took effect rather than assuming it.

// narrowNamePool pins generateName() to exactly one output for the duration of a
// test and returns it. Restored by t.Cleanup.
//
// ⚠ IT MUTATES PACKAGE STATE, so a test using it must not call t.Parallel().
// None here does.
