//
// 🔴 THIS IS THE DISCRIMINATOR A SILENT-NON-START DEFECT TURNED ON. `KickedOff`
// alone cannot separate the two failure shapes it has to serve:
//
//   - a LIVE instance whose first turn errored (model timeout, long analysis) —
//     the agent still holds the message; re-sending burns tokens and duplicates
//     work. That bleed is what the "do not re-send a kicked-off agent" guard was
//     added to stop, and it must stay stopped.
//   - a DEAD recipient (out-of-memory kill, eviction, drain) — the replacement
//     comes up healthy with an EMPTY session and no memory of the task. Nothing
//     re-sends, nothing errors, and the task sits in progress behind a healthy,
//     ready instance.
//
// Two independent movements are checked because each is blind to the other's
// shape: an in-place restart keeps the instance ID and bumps the restart COUNT;
// a replacement changes the ID and resets the COUNT to zero. Both are exact
// integers/strings from the same read — deliberately not a timestamp comparison,
// which would put this service's clock and the backend's on the two sides of a
// `>` and turn a few seconds of skew into a phantom restart on every fast
// dispatch.
//
// An empty KickoffPod means the recipient was never recorded (a row predating
// the provenance columns, or a delivery whose instance lookup failed). Those are
// exempt: detection is disabled and behaviour falls back to exactly the
// pre-existing behaviour. That is the fail-safe direction — the alternative,
// treating "unknown" as "lost", re-kicks every legacy agent in the database on
// the first tick after deploy.
//
// ⚠ ONE CONSEQUENCE TO KNOW ABOUT, and it is intended: any DELIBERATE roll of a
// kicked-off agent — re-applying a privilege grant, an image bump, a node drain
// — also changes the instance ID and therefore re-sends the kickoff. That roll
// has already killed whatever turn was running, so the choice is between
// re-delivering the task and silently doing nothing. This picks the defined one,
// and MaxKickoffAttempts caps it. If a future caller needs a roll that does NOT
// re-kick, the place to fix it is that caller: have it re-stamp KickoffPod to
// the new instance after the roll.

// DecideReconcile decides what to do for one agent given its live instance (nil

//
// Rules, in priority order:
//  1. An errored agent is sticky (stored-status-authoritative, matching
//     ComputeStatus).
//  2. A ready instance whose kickoff was never sent is recovered: retried while
//     young, errored once it has dwelt past ProvisioningStuckTimeout (the agent
//     runtime is likely dead).
//  3. A kickoff that WAS delivered, to an instance that no longer exists, is
//     re-sent while budget remains and errored once it is spent.
//  4. An agent that has dwelled in the stored `provisioning` status past
//     ProvisioningStuckTimeout without ever being kicked off is errored — keyed
//     on the stored status plus dwell, independent of whether the current
//     snapshot reads pending or absent (a dispatched-but-never-scheduled agent
//     collapses to "stopped" via ComputeStatus, so a computed-status guard
//     misses it). Otherwise the live status is recomputed; a changed status is

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 🔴 THE RECONCILE LOOP ITSELF WAS NOT CARVED WITH THIS DECISION TABLE, AND
// THIS IS THE RECORD OF IT.
//
// Upstream, everything above was private and had exactly one caller: a
// `reconcileTick` method hanging off a 1,201-line `Provisioner` that owned a
// Helm client, a Kubernetes clientset, an embedded chart, an agent-gateway HTTP
// client and the kickoff goroutines. Carrying that across would have meant
// vendoring a second provisioning implementation beside internal/provision —
// which already renders its own objects, owns its own objects by label, and
// declares its capabilities — so the loop's BODY stayed behind and its
// DECISION TABLE came over, exported.
//
// WHAT IS MISSING, PRECISELY: the driver of this table. Something must, each
// tick, list the live instances (provision.Provisioner.List), index them
// (InstanceIndex), read the stored agents (Store.List), call DecideReconcile
// per agent, and act — persist a status, launch or re-send a kickoff, or fail
// the agent with DescribeKickoffLoss + KickoffErrorSuffix. It must also be
// gated to a single process: the duplicate-kickoff guard upstream was a
// process-local map, and two processes ticking against one database both see
// `ready && !KickedOff` and both dispatch — a paid model turn, twice. This
// repository has db.LeaderGate for exactly that.
//
// ⚠ OWED, AND NAMED SO IT IS NOT AN OBJECT NOBODY CAN CLOSE: until that driver
// exists, NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY CALLS DecideReconcile — it is exported,
// tested, and unreached, and a reader who assumed otherwise would believe
// agents self-heal here today. They do not. CLOSING CONDITION: the pull request
// that adds muster's reconcile loop wires this table to a provision.Provisioner
// and a db.LeaderGate, or records the decision to drop self-healing. WHO CHECKS
// IT: the reviewer of that pull request, against this comment and against the
// fact that `git grep DecideReconcile` returns only tests today.
