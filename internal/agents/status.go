//
// 🔴 IT TAKES A provision.Instance, NOT A POD. Upstream this read a `PodInfo`
// built from the Kubernetes API, and switched on that API's own phase spellings
// ("Running", "Pending", "Failed") as bare strings. Both are now the
// provisioner contract's vocabulary, which is what lets this function answer for
// an agent running under any driver — and the [provision.Phase] constants are
// typed, so a misspelling is a compile error rather than a branch that silently
// falls through to the default.
//
// ⚠ inst.Reason IS STILL A DRIVER-DEFINED STRING and the three values matched
// below are the Kubernetes driver's spellings. That is deliberate rather than an
// oversight: the contract does not enumerate reasons, and a driver that reports
// none simply never takes this branch — it falls through to the phase, which
// every driver does set. See [provision.Instance].Reason.

// KickoffOwed reports whether this agent still OWES its first turn: a kickoff
// message is stored on the row ([Agent.PendingNote]) and nothing has delivered it
// ([Agent.KickedOff] is false).
//
// 🔴 IT IS A SEPARATE SIGNAL AND NOT A SIXTH STATUS, DELIBERATELY. The five
// values above are the agents.status CHECK constraint, they key
// [DecideReconcile]'s decision table, and every consumer switches on them; a new
// member would reach all of that untested. This answers an ORTHOGONAL question —
// "was this agent ever told what to do" — which is why it is true ALONGSIDE every
// one of the five rather than instead of one. [ComputeStatus] does not read it and
// must not, and TWO guards divide that claim rather than one:
// TestTheStatusEnumDidNotGrowToCarryAnOwedKickoff pins the declared values and
// ComputeStatus' OUTPUT SET, while TestAnOwedKickoffSurvivesEveryStatusIncludingRunning
// pins that an owed agent on a live ready instance still computes `running`. The
// second is the one that catches a ComputeStatus which READS these columns and
// answers one of the five anyway — measured: a mutant returning StatusError for an
// owed agent leaves the output set unchanged, so the enum guard alone is blind to
// it.
//
// 🔴 WHY IT IS WORTH RENDERING AT ALL, WHICH IS A MEASURED DEFECT AND NOT A
// POLISH ITEM. An agent brought up by agentprovision.Adapter.Start with its note
// never delivered reaches a live, ready instance, and ComputeStatus refines that to
// [StatusRunning] — a branch that reads neither PendingNote nor KickoffError.
// BEFORE this function had a reader the card therefore read HEALTHY over an agent
// that was never told what to do, and the only evidence was machine-tier columns:
// agents.pending_note, which had no reader at all, and agents.kickoff_error, which
// reaches one hook-token-gated JSON route. `running` + owed is the exact
// combination this exists to make visible, and it is the combination the guard
// asserts — a fixture that cannot produce it cannot see the bug.
//
// ⚠ THE PendingNote CONJUNCT IS NARROWER THAN internal/agentprovision'S OWN
// `!ag.KickedOff` TEST, AND THAT IS THE POINT RATHER THAN A DISAGREEMENT. Start
// records a non-delivery whenever the agent was never kicked off; this reports a
// first turn that is owed, and with no stored message there is no turn to deliver —
// an agent created with no note text has nothing outstanding, so flagging it would
// be a badge on every agent that was simply never dispatched with one. Both
// conjuncts are load-bearing and both are mutation-covered by
// TestKickoffOwedTruthTable.
//
// ⚠ IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHY. A refused dispatch (status `error`, nothing
// provisioned) and a running pod whose note was never handed over both answer
// true, because both owe the same turn. The reason lives in
// agents.error_message / agents.kickoff_error.
func KickoffOwed(a Agent) bool { return a.PendingNote != "" && !a.KickedOff }

// KickoffFailed reports a first turn that was HANDED to a gateway and did not
// complete: the row is stamped [Agent.KickedOff] and a failure is recorded in
// [Agent.KickoffError]. In SQL, `kicked_off AND kickoff_error <> ”`.
//
// 🔴 IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE STAMP CLEARS [KickoffOwed]. internal/agentkickoff stamps
// kicked_off BEFORE the paid turn so a turn is never run twice, and does not retry a
// turn that fails after the stamp (an operator decision: at-most-once). So
// a failed, empty, timed-out or shutdown-cancelled first turn turns the "kickoff
// owed" badge OFF while nothing was delivered — and before this predicate the
// failure lived only in kickoff_error, which no page rendered. This is that state,
// as its own signal.
//
// It is the same SHAPE as [KickoffOwed] and for the same reasons: a separate
// boolean beside the status, never a sixth status value. The two are MUTUALLY
// EXCLUSIVE by construction (one requires kicked_off, the other its negation), so a
// card never carries both badges. TestKickoffFailedTruthTable covers every cell.
//
// ⚠ IT DOES NOT READ THE NOTE. An agent kicked off by an upstream writer with no
// stored note but a recorded send failure still failed its kickoff, and says so.
//
// ⚠ WHAT KEEPS IT FROM FIRING ON A SUCCESS: every production write of kickoff_error
// on a kicked-off row is a post-stamp FAILURE (agentkickoff.recordError after the
// stamp); agentprovision writes it only on a never-kicked-off row; and a successful
// turn's agents.Store.RecordKickoffDelivery clears it — or, when that write failed,
// the deliverer clears it itself.

// error: DNS, connection refused, unreachable). internal/agentkickoff writes it;
// [KickoffResendSafe] reads it. One constant, so the writer and the reader cannot
// drift apart.
//
// 🔴 IT IS THE ONE POST-STAMP CAUSE THAT PROVES NOTHING WAS SENT. Go's HTTP client
// reports a dial error only from opening a NEW connection, before any byte of the
// request is written on it, and it does not retry a POST whose bytes were written.
// So no turn ran and none is running. (agentgateway.Gateway.Send can reach a dial
// only after a /v1/responses request that the runtime answered 404, meaning it has
// no such endpoint; that request ran no turn either.)
const KickoffNeverConnectedReason = "kickoff turn NEVER REACHED the agent runtime: the " +

const KickoffEmptyReplyReason = "kickoff turn returned an EMPTY reply, so it is recorded as NOT " +

// turn is running for it, so re-sending the task cannot pay for it twice. Only
// [KickoffNeverConnectedReason] proves that.
//
// 🔴 EVERY OTHER CAUSE ANSWERS false, AN EMPTY REPLY INCLUDED. A shutdown or a
// timeout abandons a request the runtime already received and may still be running.
// A transport error after the request was written says nothing about the runtime's
// side. And an empty reply is not a finished turn either: [KickoffEmptyReplyReason]
// itself names the cause as a runtime that DISCARDS ITS OWN SUCCESSFUL RETRY, so the
// work may have been done, or may still be under way, behind the empty answer.

//
// 🔴 WHY ERROR TEXT NEEDS THIS AT ALL: kickoff_error is muster-authored PREFIX plus,
// for a failed turn, the gateway's error — and agents' responses transport quotes up
// to 512 bytes of a non-200 runtime BODY into that error ("responses HTTP %d: %s").
// A runtime that echoes the request it rejected therefore puts the operator's note —
// instruction text, `json:"-"` everywhere — into a column this package now surfaces
// on a public-repo service. The guarantee is "no 16-byte run of the note leaves the
// process through kickoff text", which is what this enforces.
//
// 🔴 RUNS, NOT ONLY THE WHOLE NOTE, BECAUSE THE QUOTE IS TRUNCATED. A 512-byte snippet
// of a body echoing a 2 KB note contains a PREFIX of it, which strings.ReplaceAll on
// the whole note would never match. Pinned by TestScrubNoteRemovesATruncatedEcho.
//
// ⚠ ITS LIMITS, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED: a fragment shorter than 16 bytes
// survives (an echo re-escaped every few characters would leak in pieces that
// small), and a TRANSFORMED echo — case-folded, re-encoded — is not recognised.
