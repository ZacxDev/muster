// THE SEPARATION GUARDS FOR THIS PACKAGE.
//
// 🔴 THE SISTER GUARDS IN internal/notes DO NOT COVER THIS PACKAGE, AND THAT IS
// WHY THESE EXIST RATHER THAN BEING A COPY FOR TIDINESS. Both scans there read
// `os.ReadDir(".")` — the package they live in — so every assertion they make
// is scoped to internal/notes. This package was carved from the same service,
// writes its own SQL, and was the one that reached furthest into it: an
// unguarded second store is the obvious place the coupling comes back.
//
// The half left behind still owns tables with familiar names. A SQL reference
// to one of them fails at RUNTIME with an error naming a relation, long after
// review; an import of a package that talks to it does not fail at all, it just
// couples. Neither is a compile error, so neither is caught by anything else in
// this suite.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// nonTestSources returns this package's non-test .go files, keyed by base name.
//
// 🔴 IT FAILS LOUDLY ON AN EMPTY SCAN. A file walk that matches nothing returns
// a clean zero from every check below, which is indistinguishable from a clean
// package — the exact shape that makes a scanner's verdict worthless.
