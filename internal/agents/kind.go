// 🔴 KindGateway IS EVERY AGENT THAT EXISTED BEFORE KINDS DID, AND IT IS THE
// DEFAULT. It is the operator-configured runtime image reached over the
// `hooks-sha256` gateway wire (MUSTER_AGENT_IMAGE_REPO and friends). Migration
// 0003 backfills every existing row to it, and [ResolveKind] maps an unset kind
// to it, so a deployment that never names a kind builds exactly the specs it
// built before. The image's own identifier is a denied token in this public
// repository, which is why the kind is spelled after the wire it speaks.
//
// KindClaudeCode is the Claude Code pod: the claude-code-agent image (cmd/ccd +
// the pinned CLI) authenticated by one `claude setup-token` drawn from muster's
// per-account pool (internal/ccpool). Its spec profile is in
// internal/agentspec/claudecode.go.

// DECISION. ccd ends a turn that has seen no Stop/StopFailure after
// CCD_TURN_TIMEOUT (default 30m, cmd/ccd/main.go) with a TYPED
// `504 turn_timeout` whose message says the turn is still running in the
// session. If muster's client gave up first — the gateway kind's 10m
// (agentgateway.DefaultTurnTimeout) — a long Claude Code turn would surface as a
// bare client timeout with no body, ccd would stay busy until the CLI's Stop,
// and the next message would get a 409 `busy` for a turn nobody is waiting for.
// Outlasting ccd by five minutes means the typed answer always arrives first.
//
// ⚠ A TURN THAT GENUINELY RUNS LONGER THAN ccd's BUDGET STILL ENDS AS A 504 TO
// THE CALLER; the work keeps going in the TUI and is visible in the transcript.
