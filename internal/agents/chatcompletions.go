// The OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions transport: the TOOL-LESS half of
// the two an agent runtime exposes.
//
// 🔴 IT EXISTS BECAUSE /v1/responses IS NOT UNIVERSAL, AND THAT IS THE ONLY
// REASON. responses.go's own header records it: older runtime builds answer 404
// there. A caller that had only the tool loop would lose the whole turn on such
// a build — not degrade to a text answer, lose it — so this path is the fallback
// ErrResponsesUnsupported is for. It carries NO tools, and a caller must not
// pretend otherwise: a turn that silently ran here produced an answer the model
// composed with no ability to read or write anything.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM responses.go BECAUSE THE TWO WIRE FORMATS ARE
// UNRELATED. Same host, same bearer, same session-key header, and entirely
// different request and event shapes — chat-completions streams
// `choices[].delta.content` chunks with a `[DONE]` sentinel, Responses streams
// named SSE events assembled from `response.completed`. Sharing a file invited
// the assumption that a fix to one applies to the other.

// ChatMessageIn is one message in a chat-completions request.
type ChatMessageIn struct {
	Role    string `json:"role"`
	Content string `json:"content"`
}

// ChatCompletionsURL is the agent runtime's /v1/chat/completions URL, derived
// from wherever the provisioner says that instance is reachable.
//
// It is the sibling of [ResponsesURL] and shares its reasoning about taking an
// endpoint rather than a name, including the trailing-slash trim: Endpoint.Path
// is a BASE path, and a caller that spelled it "/agent/" would otherwise produce
// a double slash some routers treat as a different route.
func ChatCompletionsURL(ep provision.Endpoint) string {
	return strings.TrimSuffix(ep.URL(), "/") + "/v1/chat/completions"
}

// ChatStream POSTs a streaming chat-completions turn to the agent runtime and
// invokes emit for each assistant content delta, returning the full assembled
// assistant text. A nil emit just assembles.
//
// model is the runtime's passthrough sentinel and is REQUIRED on the wire — the
// same input [RunToolLoop] takes, for the same reason: the value belongs to the
// attached runtime, not to this package. See agentgateway for where it comes
// from.
//
// 🔴 A MALFORMED DATA LINE IS SKIPPED, NOT FATAL, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE
// ASYMMETRY WITH THE STATUS CHECK ABOVE IT. A stream that begins is a stream the
// runtime accepted; one unparseable chunk in the middle of a good turn would
// otherwise discard every delta that already arrived. A bad STATUS, by contrast,
// means the turn never started and is an error.
