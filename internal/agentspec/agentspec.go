// Package agentspec builds a [provision.Spec] from an agent row.
//
// It is plan step 22a of the extraction this project came out of (Phase 3.5). It is
// the FIRST of the three pieces that close doc_seams.go entry 1, and it is
// deliberately the piece that touches neither the provisioner wrappers nor
// the chat path: this package has no HTTP client, no cluster client, and no
// knowledge of any driver.
//
// # What it replaces, and why the shape changed
//
// Upstream, the equivalent code was buildHelmValues — a 428-line function
// returning map[string]any shaped for one vendored Helm chart, supported by
// ~1,000 further lines of helpers. Its output was only meaningful to that
// chart's templates, which is the coupling [provision.Spec] exists to remove.
//
// 🔴 THE SINGLE BIGGEST CHANGE IS THAT FILES ARE DATA. Upstream, every file
// placed into an agent travelled as
//
//	{ printf '%s' '<base64>' | base64 -d > /path; } || :
//
// appended to one giant extraInitCommands string. The `|| :` was not caution: the
// chart's startup script ran under `set -e`, so a bare non-zero exit was a crash
// loop rather than a missing file — and an audit found three shapes where the
// guard had been missed. Every file this package emits is a [provision.File]
// instead, so the driver places it natively and a test can assert the CONTENT
// rather than parsing a shell string. See [provision.File]'s own doc comment.
//
// 🔴 A COROLLARY WORTH STATING: Init survives, and it is not a dumping ground.
// A step belongs there only if it is genuinely imperative — something that must
// RUN, not something that must EXIST. Placing content in Init is how the upstream
// string grew; this package emits exactly one Init entry and argues for it below.
//
// # What this package deliberately does NOT do
//
// Each of these is a named part of another step, not an oversight. They are
// listed here because a reader's first question is "where did the rest of
// buildHelmValues go", and a missing answer reads as a gap.
//
//   - It does not generate INSTRUCTION CONTENT. Upstream that was skill.go's
//     instructionsFor/skillsFor (902 lines), which plan step 23 deletes and
//     ranked item 3 ports. This package takes the rendered text as an input
//     ([Options.Instructions]) and places it as a file. That is the right seam:
//     the mechanism and the prose have different owners and different review
//     needs.
//   - ⚠ IT DOES TOUCH CAIRN NOW, AND THIS BULLET USED TO SAY IT DID NOT. Ranked
//     item 3 ("port the chief→cairn integration") has landed: see cairn.go for
//     the client install, the credential file and the one gate that decides
//     whether either exists, and [ChiefInstructions] for the prose half. What is
//     still true is the SHAPE the old bullet was defending — the coordinates are
//     [Config] fields, eligibility is an [Options] input, and nothing in this
//     package compares an agent name against a constant to decide who gets a
//     credential. Both-unset emits nothing at all, which is the state an
//     installation that has not configured a store runs in.
//   - It does not build the GATEWAY wiring — the bearer derivation, the chat
//     transport, the responses model sentinel. That is plan step 22c, and
//     internal/agents/responses.go already carries its own OWED record naming
//     the two inputs a caller must supply.
//     ⚠ IT DOES DECLARE THE GATEWAY'S PORT NOW, AND THIS BULLET USED TO SAY
//     "the chat endpoint" AMONG WHAT IT OMITS. [DefaultGatewayPort] and
//     [Config.GatewayPort] are read by buildPorts, which is what lets a driver
//     RESOLVE an address for an instance this package specified — without it the
//     k8s driver created no Service and answered provision.ErrNoEndpoint for
//     every agent muster provisioned. That is the ADDRESS, not the transport:
//     nothing here speaks the chat wire, derives a bearer or names a model
//     sentinel, and the sentence is corrected rather than deleted because the
//     separation it draws is still the one that governs what may be added.
//   - It does not ADAPT anything to [api.Provisioner]. That is plan step 22b.
//     Nothing here implements a lifecycle method; Build is a pure function.
//
// # Purity, and what it buys
//
// Build reads no environment, no clock, no filesystem and no network. Every
// input arrives as an argument, so the same inputs always produce the same
// [provision.Spec] — which is what makes the golden in agentspec_test.go a
// meaningful pin rather than a snapshot of one machine. If you find yourself
// wanting os.Getenv here, put it in [Config] instead and let the binary resolve
// it.

// 🔴 WITHOUT A PORT IN THE SPEC, AN AGENT muster PROVISIONS HAS NO ADDRESS AT

// Build produced Ports nil, so k8s's renderService returned nil and created no
// Service; (*k8s.Driver).Endpoint read the port back from the Deployment's
// `muster.dev/port` annotation, which renderAnnotations only writes when
// Spec.PortNumber(provision.DefaultPortName) is non-zero; so
// provision.ResolveEndpoint was handed port 0 and answered
// provision.ErrNoEndpoint — "declares no port". internal/agentgateway resolves
// an endpoint BEFORE it builds a request, so that error was the only observable
// of a chat turn against such an agent. This constant is what breaks that chain.
//
// 🔴 MEASUREMENT, SO THE NUMBER IS NOT A GUESS NOBODY CAN RE-CHECK: a live pod
// of the agent runtime image the deployment this was written against pins
// answered HTTP 200 for a real `/v1/responses` turn on this port, over
// loopback inside the pod. The same pod's injected service environment exposed
// the port under the `..._SERVICE_PORT_GATEWAY` name — the same word
// provision.DefaultPortName carries — and a SECOND port one higher, which is
// that image's skills API and is NOT what a chat turn wants:
// agents.ResponsesURL appends `/v1/responses` to whatever endpoint resolves, so
// the port declared here has to be the gateway's.
//
// 🔴 A DEFAULT *WITH* AN OVERRIDE, WHICH IS STRICTLY MORE THAN THE MODEL
// SENTINEL BESIDE IT GETS, AND THE ASYMMETRY IS THE ARGUMENT. cmd/muster-server's
// config.AgentGatewayModel is configuration and NOT a constant because "the value
// belongs to the IMAGE" and no default could be right for an image this project
// has never seen. The port belongs to the image in exactly the same way — so it
// takes [Config.GatewayPort] for the same reason — but unlike an opaque sentinel
// string it has a defensible default: it is a number that was MEASURED against
// the image a deployment actually runs, and the alternative to defaulting it is
// that every deployment is unreachable until an operator discovers a variable,
// which is the state this constant exists to end. Pointing muster at a runtime
// whose gateway listens elsewhere is therefore a configuration change rather
// than a code change — the same three-layer shape provision.EndpointTemplate
// argues for on the HOST half of the address.
//
// ⚠ IT IS DECLARED WHETHER OR NOT A CHAT GATEWAY IS CONFIGURED, deliberately.
// The port reaches the cluster at CREATE time (the Service and the annotation are
// both written by k8s apply), so gating it on the gateway tier would leave every
