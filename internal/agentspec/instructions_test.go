// and chiefLiveReads had no whole-string pin of any kind. Reproduced end to end: a
// private path and a private filename pasted into chiefLiveReads — which ships in
// EVERY supervisor prompt, store-configured or not — left this package,
// internal/agentprovision and cmd/muster-server all green and leakscan reporting
// nothing.

// difference from the loop it replaces, whose own criticism stands: a list of
// case-sensitive literals passes while the same hazard exists in any other shape.
// This test cannot be walked by reshaping the text, because it does not read the
// text. It pins every PART of the prompt by digest, and then pins that the prompt is
// NOTHING BUT those parts — new words in an existing part fail a digest, a new part
// fails the composition.

// ⚠ IT IS A CHANGE SIGNAL, AND THE DETECTOR IS THE HUMAN READING THE DIFF. No digest
// can tell you a sentence is free of private detail; it can only refuse to let the
// sentence ship unlooked-at. So this test is named for what it does — nothing reaches
// the prompt without a pin — rather than for the property the removed loop's name
// claimed and did not have.
//
// ⚠ THE COMPOSITION CHECK IS A COMPLETENESS CLAIM AND NOT A VALUE ONE. Comparing
// ChiefInstructions against the constants it concatenates says nothing about what
// those constants SAY; it says only that no fifth string and no inline text can enter
// the rendered prompt unpinned. It is load-bearing only because each part carries its

// 🔴 THE FORBIDDEN-LITERAL LOOP THAT USED TO LEAD THIS TEST IS GONE, AND THE REASON
// RECORDED HERE FOR REMOVING IT WAS FALSE. The loop listed four case-sensitive
// strings — a private repository's name, a filename, a directory, and one spelling of
// a dated measurement. The half that stands: a guard on WORDS is walkable by any
// other shape (a different private path, a different case, a date written another
// way), and it was duplicated twice over. The half that was measured FALSE: this
// comment claimed tests/leakscan.py and
// TestTheStoreSectionIsPinnedWholeRatherThanByKeyword's digest "own" those four
// strings between them. Neither does — leakscan produces no finding for three of the
// four, and the digest covers chiefCairnSection only. So removing the loop removed
// coverage. What replaced it is not the loop but
// TestNoTextReachesTheSupervisorPromptWithoutAPin, which pins the WHOLE rendered
// prompt and carries that measurement.
//
// ⚠ WHAT REMAINS IS A REAL AND UNDUPLICATED ASSERTION, which is why the test stayed
// rather than going with the loop. The upstream text cited the canonical write
// protocol by a path inside the operator's own private configuration repository. The
// port replaced the path with an ATTRIBUTION, and attribution is the load-bearing
// half: an agent that reads its own weaker check as the whole protocol reports a
// write as validated when nothing validated it. A digest notices that sentence
// moving; only this test says why it must not.
