// Capabilities is what a driver can actually do.

// 🔴 A CAPABILITY NOBODY BRANCHES ON IS NOT A GUARD, IT IS A FIELD. Every bool
// here is refused on somewhere, and each one's refusal is spelled in exactly
// one place: Files, Secrets, Persistence and ResourceLimits in [CheckSpec];
// Scale in [CheckSpec] and [CheckScale], which are one rule reached by two
// entry points; Policy in [Grant]; Exec in [Exec]. A predicate open-coded per
// driver instead is a predicate that is wrong in all but one of them, in the
// same direction, and nobody hears the disagreement.
//
// ⚠ Isolation IS THE EXCEPTION, AND IT HAS NO BRANCH AT ALL. Both drivers
// WRITE it; nothing in this repository READS it. It is kept because
// [IsolationNone] is a safety statement — an agent running as the muster
// process's own user, with its credentials — that a future CheckSpec should be
// able to refuse on, and that branch does not exist yet. Until it does,
// Isolation is a field and not a guard, and this comment says so rather than
// supplying it a purpose. Do not read the sentence above as covering it.
//
// Every bool is false-by-default and false means "cannot", so a driver that
// forgets to declare something is treated as unable to do it. That is the safe
// direction: the failure is a refusal a developer sees immediately, not a
// silent downgrade a user discovers later. Isolation is safe in the same
// direction for a different reason — its zero value is IsolationNone, the LEAST
// isolated level, so forgetting to declare it understates isolation.

	// environment. False means Spec.Secrets and secret Files are refused rather
	// than written somewhere readable.
	//
	// ⚠ A container daemon is the motivating false case. Its secret support is
	// an orchestrator feature, so a plain-daemon driver has only environment
	// variables and bind mounts, and an environment variable is visible to
	// anything that can read the process table.
	Secrets bool

	// Files: the driver can place Spec.Files natively.
	Files bool

	// Policy: the driver can attach an identity-scoped authorisation policy to
	// an instance — cluster RBAC and its equivalents. See Grant for why a false
	// here must produce a REFUSAL rather than a no-op.
	Policy bool

	// Persistence: storage that outlives the instance's process.
	Persistence bool

	// ResourceLimits: enforceable cpu/memory ceilings.
	ResourceLimits bool

	// Scale: replica counts other than 0 and 1.
	Scale bool

// Every driver calls it at the top of Create and Update, before it touches a
// backend. It returns an error wrapping [ErrUnsupported] naming the capability
// and what the spec asked for, so the refusal is legible to whoever wrote the
// spec rather than being a generic rejection.
//
// 🔴 THE REFUSALS ARE NOT PEDANTRY. Each one is a case where honouring part of
// a spec and dropping the rest produces something that LOOKS like it worked:
// secrets written into plain environment, a resource ceiling that is not
// enforced, a workspace that is a tmpfs. Silently degrading any of those is the
// shape the original project's noop driver had, where every method returned nil
// and the interface reported success for work nobody did.
