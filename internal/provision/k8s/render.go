// comments and two runnable `kubectl -o jsonpath=` recipes — and was wrong in the
// same direction in every one of them: they all named the pod template. A
// correctly-provisioned instance therefore printed EMPTY for the recipe that was
// supposed to confirm it, under an instruction to STOP if the output was empty. One
// predicate open-coded at N sites is usually wrong at N-1; this one was wrong at N.

// The probe timings this driver translates [provision.Health] into.
//
// 🔴 THEY LIVE HERE RATHER THAN ON provision.Health BECAUSE THEY ARE SPELLED IN
// THIS BACKEND'S UNITS. A period and a failure threshold are a Kubernetes shape;
// another backend expresses supervision as a retry budget, a restart policy or
// nothing at all. What the SPEC declares is the portable half — "GET this path on
// this port means serving" — and translating it is the driver's job. That is the
// same division [provision.Resources] draws by keeping quantities as strings.
//
// 🔴 THE NUMBERS ARE TAKEN FROM A DEPLOYMENT OF THE SAME AGENT RUNTIME IMAGE THAT
// IS KNOWN TO WORK, NOT CHOSEN. That deployment's gateway container carries a
// startup probe of GET / on the gateway port with failureThreshold 30, period 10s
// and initialDelay 5s, and a liveness probe of the same request with
// failureThreshold 3 and period 30s. Measured against the image muster's own
// deployment pins: a cold container reached `[gateway] ready` 1.3s after start, so
// the 305s startup budget is roughly 200x the observed need — deliberately, because
// the budget has to cover a loaded node and a cold page cache, and the cost of it
// being too generous is a slower crash report while the cost of it being too tight
// is a restart loop that never lets a healthy agent finish booting.
//
// ⚠ A STARTUP PROBE IS WHAT MAKES THE LIVENESS PROBE SAFE, AND THE PAIR MUST MOVE
// TOGETHER. Kubernetes suspends liveness until startup succeeds; a liveness probe
// with no startup probe would kill every container that takes longer than
// livenessFailureThreshold x livenessPeriodSeconds to boot, which is 90s here and
// is well inside the range an image pull plus a repository clone can reach.

// SET THE REFERENCE DEPLOYMENT HAPPENED TO HAVE.
//
// The startup probe already gates the container's FIRST Ready — Kubernetes holds
// a container unready until startup succeeds — which is the signal muster needs:
// provision.Instance.Ready is what tells an operator a provisioned agent came up
// at all, and it is the mechanical half of this change's closing condition. What a
// readiness probe would add on top is continuous REMOVAL from the Service after
// startup, on the identical request, which for a single-replica Deployment serving
// chat means one slow response takes the agent out of its own Service mid-turn and
// the chat failure reads as a muster defect. The hang case that argument gives up
// is covered by liveness, which restarts rather than hides.
//
// 🔴 IF A SECOND REPLICA EVER BECOMES POSSIBLE, RE-ARGUE THIS. The reasoning above
// is specific to replicas: 1, where "pulled from the Service" and "unreachable"
// are the same thing. With two replicas a readiness probe is how traffic avoids a
