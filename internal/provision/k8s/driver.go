//     it: the NetworkPolicy this driver renders for an isolated instance
//     (network.go) is an ADDRESS-RANGE policy — DNS plus the spec's ports on
//     public addresses — so an isolated instance can still reach any public host
//     on those ports. What it keeps the instance off is every address in
//     nonPublicIPv4 EXCEPT THE CLUSTER'S DNS PODS (reachable on port 53, which
//     is itself a channel) — so the cluster and the LAN WHERE THOSE ARE PRIVATE
//     ADDRESSES, which is a property of the cluster and not something this
//     driver checks (see that variable's ⚠). It does not keep data in. Neither
//     does the RBAC
//     that Policy true announces. And an instance whose spec declares no
//     isolation gets no NetworkPolicy at all.
//   - IT RUNS NO SIDECARS. One container plus an init container. The chart this
//     replaces could run three log tailers, and they were structurally
//     invisible to that project's own log reads anyway.
//
// Both were once Capabilities fields. They were deleted because nothing
// branched on them and no Spec field could ever ask for either, so they
// announced a loss to a caller that had no decision to make — which is a

// 🔴 AN OWNERSHIP REFUSAL IS NOT UNREACHABILITY, AND THIS IS THE ONE PLACE THE
// WRITE PATH DISTINGUISHES THEM. All five upserts in apply() used to wrap their
// error in blind() directly, so a PERMANENT refusal to write over somebody
// else's ServiceAccount, ConfigMap, Secret, Service or Deployment arrived at the
// caller as provision.ErrBlind — a TRANSIENT "backend unreachable". Measured at
// 138d269 under both namespace layouts: errors.Is(err, ErrBlind) true,
// errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound) false, errors.As(err, **notManagedError) false.
// A caller that retries on ErrBlind therefore never converges, one that alerts
// on it pages for an outage that is not happening, and the refusal's own type
// and sentinel were gone.
//
// 🔴 THE HEDGE THIS COMMENT USED TO CARRY — "nothing stops a SIXTH site calling
// blind() directly" — WAS ALREADY TRUE WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN, of the two upserts
// in policy.go's Grant. Consolidating apply's five sites here left the
// security-critical RBAC path out of the consolidation entirely, and a predicate
// applied at some of its sites is wrong at the rest of them in the same
// direction. Measured at f373092 with a foreign co-named ClusterRole in the way:
// errors.Is(err, ErrBlind) true, errors.Is(err, ErrNotManaged) false. Every
// write in this driver that can collide with a stranger's object now returns
// through this function; policy.go has no blind() call on a collision path left.
//
// 🔴 IT KEYS ON THE SENTINEL, NOT ON THE CONCRETE TYPE, AND THAT IS THE WIDER
// PREDICATE. errors.As(err, **notManagedError) would misroute any refusal that
// reports provision.ErrNotManaged through a plain fmt.Errorf — ensureNamespace's
// does, for the reason stated there — straight back into blind(), which is the

// notManagedError is the refusal every by-name path returns for an object this

//
// 🔴 IT ALWAYS REPORTS provision.ErrNotManaged. It reports ErrNotFound ONLY
// when a by-name READ produced it, and the asymmetry is the whole reason this
// type carries a flag instead of being one shape:
//
//   - A READ (Get, Scale, Endpoint, the log paths) asked "what is instance X".
//     A stranger's co-named object is not instance X, so "muster has no
//     instance by that name" is the right answer and ErrNotFound is the right
//     sentinel — reporting it as an instance is how a status read describes a
//     stranger's Deployment as an agent.
//   - An ACTION (an upsert inside apply, or Destroy) asked muster to WRITE or
//     REMOVE X. "There is no such instance" is not what happened. Worse,
//     `if err != nil && !errors.Is(err, provision.ErrNotFound)` is the idiom
//     Destroy's contract invites, so an ErrNotFound-flavoured refusal there is
//     SILENTLY DISCARDED — which is the opposite of being loud.
//
// 🔴 THE CONCRETE TYPE SURVIVES errors.As ON EVERY PATH THAT CONSTRUCTS IT, AND
// THAT IS NARROWER THAN "ON EVERY PATH" — which is what this comment used to
// say. One refusal about a foreign object is NOT this type: ensureNamespace
// returns a plain fmt.Errorf wrapping provision.ErrNotManaged, because its
// message has to carry a reason this type's fixed format cannot express ("Destroy
// deletes this namespace and everything in it"); ownership_test.go asserts the
// "refusing to adopt" half of that sentence. So errors.Is(err,

//
// Nothing load-bearing depends on the difference: notManagedError is unexported,
// so no caller outside this package can errors.As for it at all, and the two

// checkNamespaceOwned is Destroy's PRE-FLIGHT over the per-instance namespace:

//
// 🔴 IT RUNS BEFORE THE FIRST DELETE, AND THAT ORDER IS THE FIX FOR A MEASURED
// INCOHERENCE. The check used to live at the END of Destroy, so a foreign
// namespace holding an instance whose own objects WERE muster's produced this:
// the Deployment, the ServiceAccount, every satellite and every policy object
// were removed, and then Destroy returned provision.ErrNotManaged — measured on
// three consecutive calls, with Get reporting ErrNotFound in between. A caller
// looking at that cannot tell a refusal that changed nothing from one that tore
// the instance down, and "Destroy until nil" never terminates. Checked first,
// the two states are the only two there are: muster owns the namespace and
// destroys everything (nil), or it does not and destroys NOTHING (a stable
// ErrNotManaged, with Get still reporting the instance).
//
// ⚠ THE COST IS THAT AN AGENT MUSTER CREATED KEEPS RUNNING. If somebody
// relabels the namespace out from under an instance, Destroy will not stop its
// pod until the label is put back or the namespace is removed by hand. That is
// the same answer this driver already gives for a foreign co-named DEPLOYMENT —
// the other identity anchor — and it is the price of the alternative being the
// non-convergent teardown above. It is NOT a claim that leaving the pod running
// is harmless.
//
// ⚠ WHY THE CO-NAMED SATELLITES ARE STILL SKIPPED QUIETLY. A foreign
// ConfigMap, Secret, Service, claim, ServiceAccount or NetworkPolicy under the
// instance's name
// stays a logged skip (deleteIfOwned). The distinction is which objects are the
// instance's IDENTITY ANCHORS: a foreign Deployment or a foreign per-instance
// Namespace means no instance can exist under this name under ANY spec — Create
// refuses both unconditionally — whereas a foreign satellite blocks only a spec
// that RENDERS that object, and Destroy has no spec to consult. Destroy cannot
// tell a satellite that would have been refused from one that would never have
// been touched, so it does not act on it.
//
// 🔴 WHAT THE SKIP DOES **NOT** MEAN: that the foreign satellite survives. Under
// NamespacePerInstance — the only layout in which this function runs — Destroy
// goes on to delete the namespace WHOLE, and ensureNamespace's own comment says
// namespace deletion "schedules the deletion of everything in it". So in this
// layout the quiet skip saves the object from being deleted BY NAME and not from
// being deleted at all. This paragraph previously claimed "leaving it alone is
// right either way", which is false here. ⚠ NOT MEASURED: the fake clientset
// these tests run against implements no namespace garbage collection, so the
// suite is structurally blind to the consequence and cannot tell the two
// readings apart; the statement above is Kubernetes semantics plus this file's
// own comment, NOT an observation from this repository. The place the skip is
// unambiguously right is the SHARED-namespace layout, where nothing deletes a
// namespace and this function never runs.
//
// ⚠ SO THIS IS NOT "LOUD WHEREVER CREATE REFUSES", which is the tidier sentence
// and is false: Create DOES refuse a foreign co-named ConfigMap when the spec
// carries files, and Destroy skips that same object. The split is between
// anchors and satellites, not between loud and quiet Creates.

//
// 🔴 BOTH IDENTITY ANCHORS ARE CHECKED BEFORE ANYTHING IS DELETED, so a refusal
// and a teardown are never the same call. Either muster owns the name and
// removes everything under it, or it refuses and removes NOTHING; there is no

// if the namespace is REPLACED between the pre-flight and the delete, the
// re-read in destroyNamespace refuses after the objects are gone — the state
// genuinely changed under us, so the report is accurate, but a caller sees the
// removed-then-refused shape again. Closing it needs a delete precondition on
// the object's UID, which the fake clientset cannot enforce (see deleteIfOwned),
// so it would be code no test here could exercise. It is a race window, not the
