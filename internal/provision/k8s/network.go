//     instance already carries (instanceLabels) — the same selector its Service
//     and its Deployment use;
//   - INGRESS: the spec's declared ports, from pods matching ControllerPodLabels
//     in ControllerNamespace. The two selectors are ONE peer, so they are ANDed:
//     written as two peers they would be ORed, and would admit every pod in the
//     controller's namespace plus every namespace's pods carrying those labels;
//   - EGRESS: UDP and TCP 53 to the cluster's DNS pods, and each of the spec's
//     PublicEgressTCPPorts to [publicIPv4] except [nonPublicIPv4].

// about IPv6, and with the Egress type listed anything no rule allows is refused.
