// The sentinel errors every driver reports through. They are sentinels rather

// those apart from prose.

	// ErrNotFound — the backend was reached and does not have this instance.
	ErrNotFound = errors.New("provision: instance not found")

	// ErrBlind — the driver could not reach its backend, so it knows NOTHING.
	//
	// 🔴 THIS IS THE ERROR THAT MUST NOT BECOME AN EMPTY SLICE. See the contract
	// rules in the package doc: a caller reads a List error as "keep the stored
	// status" and an empty List as "nothing is running", so a driver that
	// swallows a connection failure and returns `nil, nil` rewrites every
	// instance's state to stopped and looks, from the outside, like a cluster
	// that emptied itself.
	ErrBlind = errors.New("provision: backend unreachable")

	// ErrNotManaged — the backend was REACHED, and it has an object under the
	// name this instance asks for that the driver did not create.
	//
	// 🔴 IT IS A PERMANENT DECISION AND IT IS NOT ErrBlind. Five call sites in
	// the kubernetes driver's apply() wrapped this refusal in the ErrBlind
	// constructor, which formats with %v, so a caller saw only "backend
	// unreachable": a refusal that will never resolve on its own presented as a
	// transient fault, so a caller that retries never converges and a caller
	// that alerts pages for an outage that is not happening. TWO MORE were
	// found a round later, in that driver's Grant — the path that hands out
	// cluster RBAC — because the fix consolidated apply's sites and nobody
	// asked which OTHER paths wrote objects. A predicate corrected at some of
	// its sites is wrong at the rest of them, in the same direction.
	//
	// 🔴 A BY-NAME READ ALSO REPORTS ErrNotFound; A WRITE OR A TEARDOWN DOES
	// NOT. Those are different questions with different right answers, and the
	// asymmetry is deliberate:
	//
	//   - Get, Scale, Endpoint and the log paths were asked "what is instance
	//     X". A stranger's co-named object is not instance X, so the answer is
	//     "muster has no instance by that name" — ErrNotFound AND this.
	//     Reporting it as an instance is how a status read describes somebody
	//     else's Deployment as an agent.
	//   - Update, Destroy and Grant were asked to ACT on X. "There is no such
	//     instance" is not what happened — something else holds the name and
	//     muster refused — so these report this sentinel ALONE. Reporting
	//     ErrNotFound there is worse than imprecise: `if err != nil &&
	//     !errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound)` is the idiom Destroy's own contract
	//     invites, and it SILENTLY DISCARDS the refusal.
	//
	// 🔴 Create IS AN EXCEPTION AND THIS DOC USED TO NAME IT AS A PRODUCER.
	// Measured: Create over a foreign co-named Deployment gives
	// errors.Is(err, ErrDivergentSpec) true and errors.Is(err, ErrNotManaged)
	// FALSE. That is the DECISION, not a defect — "refused, nothing written" is
	// the branch Create's caller already has, and a single error claiming to be
	// both a divergence and an ownership refusal makes the caller's switch
	// order decide which one it is. The refusal's PROSE still names the label
	// that is wrong, because relabelling is the only escape. The kubernetes
	// driver's ownership tests now assert the absence of this sentinel there,
	// which nothing did while this paragraph was wrong.
	//
	// It is not pinned by provisiontest.RunContract: a driver has to have a
	// SHARED backend for a foreign co-named object to be expressible at all,
	// and Noop's backend is its own map, so a contract case would be
	// unfalsifiable for half the drivers in this repository. It is pinned in
	// the kubernetes driver's own ownership tests instead.
	ErrNotManaged = errors.New("provision: an object under this name is not managed by this driver")

	// ErrDivergentSpec — Create was called for an instance that already exists
	// with a materially different spec. The caller that meant to change it has
	// Update.
	ErrDivergentSpec = errors.New("provision: instance exists with a different spec")

	// Destroy removes the instance and everything the driver created for it.
	//
	// 🔴 IT RETURNS nil ONLY IF THE INSTANCE WAS REMOVED OR WAS ALREADY ABSENT.
	// Anything else — a partial teardown, an unreachable backend, an object
	// that survived the delete — is an error. A `return nil` that means "I did
	// not try" is the defect this sentence exists to forbid.
	//
	// 🔴 A FOREIGN OBJECT UNDER THE INSTANCE'S NAME IS NOT "ALREADY ABSENT",
	// AND IT IS NOT nil. On a shared backend a name is not an identity:
	// something the driver did not create can already hold the name, and a
	// teardown that proceeded by name alone would delete a stranger's objects
	// and report success. A driver on such a backend MUST return
	// [ErrNotManaged] — and must NOT make that error satisfy
	// errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound), because `if err != nil && !errors.Is(err,
	// ErrNotFound)` is the idiom this contract invites and it would discard the
	// refusal. Which objects count as the instance's identity is the driver's
	// call; the kubernetes driver's Destroy doc states its answer.
	//
	// 🔴 AN OWNERSHIP REFUSAL FROM Destroy MEANS NOTHING WAS REMOVED, AND IT IS
	// TERMINAL. A driver must check every object it treats as the instance's
	// identity BEFORE it deletes anything, so the two outcomes are the only two
	// there are: the instance is gone (nil), or the backend is exactly as it
	// was (ErrNotManaged). A driver that removed the instance and THEN reported
	// a permanent refusal leaves a caller unable to tell which happened — and
	// "retry Destroy until it returns nil" never terminates, because the
	// refusal is about state only an operator can change. The kubernetes driver
	// had that defect where an instance's own objects were muster's and its
	// per-instance NAMESPACE was a stranger's: three consecutive Destroys
	// returned the same ErrNotManaged with the instance already torn down. It
	// now refuses first and removes nothing, so the pod keeps running until the
	// namespace is relabelled or removed. Callers branch on the SENTINEL: retry
	// [ErrBlind], surface [ErrNotManaged] to a human, treat nil as done.
