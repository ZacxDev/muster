// and the semantics are identical; a second spelling would be a second convention
// to drift.
//
// A dismissed task carries a non-NULL notes.deleted_at and must be invisible to
// EVERY application path — the board, the machine API, the dispatch picker, the
// tag vocabulary, the idle-task reaper (which would otherwise re-reap dismissed
// rows forever) and every mutator.
//
// 🔴 It is deliberately applied to the WRITES as well as the reads. Filtering only
// the reads would leave `SetStatus`/`UpdateNote`/`AddTags` half-writing: the UPDATE
// would land on the dismissed row and the follow-up Get would then answer
// ErrNoRows, i.e. a mutation that reports failure while having succeeded. With the
// predicate on both, a dismissed task simply does not exist until Restore.
//
// COMMENTS are NOT filtered by liveOnly on the reads — they are REDACTED by
// commentCols instead. See that constant for why.
//
// ListAttachments / GetAttachment stay unfiltered — attachments have no
// deleted_at, and they are by-note-id child reads every handler reaches only
// through a parent Get. That is also what lets an operator enumerate a dismissed
// task's surviving attachments while deciding whether to Restore it.

// commentCols is the SINGLE comment projection — the ONE place
// retraction is applied on a read, used by both comment reads (ListComments and
// listCommentsForNotes) so they cannot drift, exactly as noteCols keeps the note
// reads aligned. Its column order matches scanCommentInto.
//
// 🔴 REDACT, DO NOT FILTER — and redact IN POSTGRES. Two independent reasons:
//
//  1. A retracted comment stays in the thread as a TOMBSTONE so the thread cannot
//     silently SHORTEN. A comment that merely vanishes is the worse failure mode
//     on a board agents read as authoritative: a quiet mass retraction leaves no
//     trace at all, whereas the task delete it was modelled on at least makes a
//     card visibly disappear. Position and created_at survive; only the body goes.
//  2. The CASE runs server-side, so the retracted text is never selected out of
//     the database. That is stronger than hiding it in the renderer: no read path
//     — the HTML card, the machine JSON, a future export — can leak a body it was
//     never given. "Absent from the page" is a property of the query here, not a
//     property of each consumer remembering to check the flag.
//
// The knock-on that keeps this ONE rule rather than two: because the row is still
// returned, len(Note.Comments) counts tombstones, so apiTaskSummary.CommentCount
// and the card's "N comments" badge (both plain len()) stay consistent with what
// is rendered without either of them learning about retraction.
//
// 🔴 The empty-string branch is deliberately NOT the placeholder text. The
// tombstone COPY belongs to the renderer (internal/ui); baking it into SQL would
// make it indistinguishable from a real comment body whose author typed it.

	// cannot hide in a package-level constant. Parking it outside a function body
	// would make this query invisible to that ledger — see the ListPage entry in
	// wantCommentSites for what the ledger can and cannot say about it.
	//
	// 🔴 EACH JOIN IS A DIFFERENT PRODUCER, AND THEY DO NOT ALL FEED updated_at.
	// Measured on this tree rather than assumed:
	//
	//   - note_comments — AddComment ALREADY bumps notes.updated_at in the same
	//     statement (see the `bump` CTE there), so for every comment this lateral
	//     actually COUNTS today this term is defence-in-depth, not the live
	//     mechanism. (The qualifier is load-bearing: PGStore.FlagIdle is a second
	//     store comment writer and it deliberately does NOT bump updated_at — but
	//     its comments are exactly the ones the author filter below removes, so
	//     "everything counted here also bumped" stays true.) It stays because it
	//     costs nothing and the invariant it protects ("a thread with newer
	//     activity than its note sorts by the activity") is one a future comment
	//     path — a backfill, a direct INSERT, a migration — would otherwise break
	//     silently.
	//
	//     🔴 THE `c.author <> ReapCommentAuthor` FILTER IS DONE, NOT OUTSTANDING —
	//     it is in the SQL below. This entry used to be a MERGE-ORDER CONSTRAINT
	//     addressed to whichever of #727/#729 merged second; #727 landed first
	//     (1041d87ce) and #729 carries the filter. What it guards, so nobody
	//     deletes it as noise: PGStore.FlagIdle writes a ReapCommentAuthor comment
	//     WITHOUT bumping notes.updated_at — deliberately, because updated_at is
	//     the reaper's own selection predicate. Unfiltered, GREATEST(...) would
	//     resolve to that comment's created_at = now() and float a task nobody
	//     touched to the TOP of the board, reintroducing the inverted ordering this
	//     flat board exists to remove. Neither PR's own tests could see it: the
	//     break needs BOTH sides. Pinned behaviourally by
	//     TestReapedTaskDoesNotFloatToTheTopOfTheBoard.
	//
	//     🔴 IT IS THE ONLY AUTHOR EXCLUDED, AND THAT IS THE RULE, NOT A LIST. The
	//     filter is not "hide robots" — every other comment author, human or agent,
	//     IS activity and must float its task. What earns the exclusion is the one
	//     property FlagIdle has and nothing else does: it writes a comment while
	//     deliberately NOT writing updated_at. Any future writer with that property
	//     needs the same treatment; any writer that bumps updated_at does not.
	//   - agents — every agent mutation writes `agents.updated_at = now()` and
	//     NONE of them touch the note. An agent that provisions, runs and errors
	//     moved the task not at all under the old ordering. This term is why a
	//     task being worked RIGHT NOW floats to the top.
	//   - task_sessions — LinkSession writes last_seen_at and, likewise, never
	//     bumps the note. A session picking a task up is real activity the board
	//     could not see.
	//
	// 🔴 THE COMMENT LATERAL CARRIES NO `deleted_at IS NULL` — and that omission is
	// deliberate, not an oversight the author filter above forgot to extend. A
	// RETRACTED comment still happened, and retracting one must not silently sink
	// the task back down the board; that is the same "tombstone, do not filter"
	// rule comment soft delete applies to the thread itself. Pinned behaviourally by
	// TestListPageRetractedCommentStillFloatsTheTask.
	//
	// ⚠ The two predicates are opposites on purpose and must not be "unified": the
	// AUTHOR filter removes an event that never was activity, the absent DELETED_AT
	// filter keeps an event that was activity and later got retracted. A retracted
	// REAP comment is excluded by the first, which is also correct — it was never
	// activity either.
	//
	// LATERAL + max() rather than LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY: the plain join would
	// multiply note rows by their comments before aggregating, which then has to
	// be undone with a GROUP BY over all 14 note columns. The lateral keeps the
	// query one-row-per-note by construction.
	//
	// The reap-author exclusion is CONCATENATED FROM THE Go CONSTANT rather than
	// bound as a query parameter, deliberately: ReapCommentAuthor is a compile-time
	// const so there is nothing to inject, the joins are built before the WHERE
	// clause's $N numbering starts (a bound author would have to be $1 and shift
	// every filter argument), and spelling it as the constant is what makes

// APPLIES TIES; that is a different reason from the one written down, and a
// reader auditing the argument would have concluded it held.
//

// round-trip, no error left to discard. `bump` reads note_id FROM ins, so an

// FlagIdle tags an idle task and posts ONE reap comment, at most once per idle
// period, WITHOUT touching updated_at. See the Store interface for the full
// rationale; the two things to keep in view while reading the SQL:
//
//  1. 🔴 `updated_at` IS ABSENT FROM THE SET LIST ON PURPOSE. Every other mutator
//     in this file writes it; this one must not, because it is the field the
//     reaper's own selection predicate reads. There is no BEFORE UPDATE trigger on
//     `notes` to put it back (the soft-delete design says so explicitly, and
//     TestFlagIdleDoesNotMoveUpdatedAt measures it), so omitting it here really
//     does leave the row's clock alone.
//
//  2. 🔴 THE `NOT EXISTS` IS THE ANTI-SPAM GUARD, and it is NOT race-safe on its
//     own — the EXPLICIT `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` below is what makes it so, and the
//     two must be read together. Deleting the lock statement leaves a guard that
//     still passes every SEQUENTIAL test and duplicates the comment under
//     concurrency; TestFlagIdleWritesOnceUnderConcurrency is what catches that.
//
//     🔴 A RETRACTED CLAIM, recorded so it is not re-derived: this used to say
//     that Postgres's EvalPlanQual re-check made the bare `NOT EXISTS` sufficient
//     ("the loser's re-check sees the winner's comment"). MEASURED FALSE against
//     Postgres 16. EvalPlanQual re-evaluates the qual against the updated `notes`
//     TUPLE, but the `NOT EXISTS` subplan on `note_comments` still reads the
//     STATEMENT's original snapshot — the documented rule is "it can see the
//     effects of concurrent updating commands on the same rows it is trying to
//     update, but it does not see effects of those commands on other rows". The
//     loser therefore looked at a pre-winner snapshot of note_comments, found
//     nothing, and inserted a second comment: 12/12 trials with 4 concurrent
//     callers double-wrote. Nor did the leader gate cover it — `leadsRetention`
//     is a per-PROCESS lease check, and reapIdleTasks has TWO in-process callers
//     (RunTaskReap at 30m and retentionPass at 24h, whose ticks coincide on every
//     pod that lives past a day), so both goroutines pass the same gate.
//
//     The lock is the fix because SNAPSHOT TIMING, not the qual, was the problem:
//     the loser blocks on `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, and the CTE that follows is a
//     SEPARATE command, so under READ COMMITTED it takes a fresh snapshot after
//     the lock was granted and the winner's comment is visible to it. The
//     isolation level is pinned explicitly on the transaction rather than
//     inherited, because the mechanism IS the per-command snapshot: at REPEATABLE
//     READ there is only the transaction snapshot. What that costs was measured
//     rather than assumed — the loser does not duplicate, it FAILS with
//     `could not serialize access due to concurrent update` (SQLSTATE 40001), so
//     a server whose default_transaction_isolation was raised would turn every
//     concurrent sweep into a logged store error instead of a write. Either way
//     this method wants READ COMMITTED, so it asks for it.
//
//  3. 🔴 THE MARKER IS `>=`, NOT `>`, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING FOR THE EXISTING
//     BOARD. The PREVIOUS implementation reaped with AddTags + AddComment, and
//     AddComment inserts the comment (created_at DEFAULT now()) and writes
//     `updated_at = now()` in the SAME statement — `now()` is the transaction
//     timestamp, so those two land on the IDENTICAL value. Under `>`, equal is
//     not greater, so every legacy reap was invisible to its successor and the
//     first sweep after deploy would have re-commented the whole flagged
//     population. (What was MEASURED is the per-task behaviour: replay the old
//     reaper verbatim, then call FlagIdle, and it writes again. The ~180-task
//     size of that population is a quoted live-board figure, not something this
//     change re-measured.) Pinned by
//     TestFlagIdleRecognisesAReapWrittenByThePreviousImplementation.
//
//     A consequence worth stating, because it is what makes ReapCommentAuthor's
//     hazard REAL rather than theoretical: `>=` means a ReapCommentAuthor comment
//     written through AddComment DOES satisfy the marker (its created_at ties the
//     updated_at it just wrote), so a second writer under that author really can
//     suppress idle flagging. Under `>` it could not, and that guard would have
//     been describing an unreachable hazard.
//
// The INSERT feeds off `tagged`, so tag and comment land together or not at all,
// and both live in ONE statement inside the transaction — no partial state, no
// discarded error. `liveOnly` on the UPDATE is the ONLY dismissal check — the
// lock SELECT deliberately does not repeat it, so the rule stays in one place AND
// the earlier command cannot mask a regression in the later one. Measured, not
// assumed: with the lock in place, deleting `liveOnly` from this UPDATE still
// fails TestFlagIdleRefusesDismissedAndUnknownTasks with its own message.
//
// 🔴 ORDERING CONSUMERS, READ THIS. This is the one comment writer in the package
// that is deliberately INVISIBLE to notes.updated_at, so a reap is deliberately
// not "activity". Any read that derives a task's activity time or board position
// from note_comments.created_at — a GREATEST(...) over the thread, a max(),
// an ORDER BY on a comment lateral — MUST exclude comments authored by
// ReapCommentAuthor, or reaping a task will float it to the top of the board and
// reintroduce, by a different route, the inverted ordering this method exists to
// remove. That constraint is a property of THIS writer; it holds for whatever
// activity-ordering change lands, not for one particular pull request.
//
// ✅ There is exactly ONE such consumer in the tree today and it IS filtered:
// ListPage's `cm` activity lateral carries `AND c.author <> ReapCommentAuthor`
// (added when this branch merged the flat activity-ordered board). So this
// paragraph is a rule for the NEXT such reader, not an open TODO — and the rule
// is kept honest behaviourally by TestReapedTaskDoesNotFloatToTheTopOfTheBoard,
// which reaps a real task and requires it not to move above a more recent one.
