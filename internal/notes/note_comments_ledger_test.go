// The note_comments SEAM ledger.
//
// 🔴 THE DEFECT SHAPE THIS EXISTS FOR. A retraction rule applied at N−1 of N query
// sites is the classic failure here, and it is INVISIBLE to a behavioural test
// scoped to one surface: the per-note read (ListComments, behind Get and so behind
// GET /api/tasks/{id} and the re-rendered card) and the batched read
// (listCommentsForNotes, behind List/ListByTags and so behind GET /api/tasks and
// the whole board) return the same rows through different SQL. Fix one and the
// task view looks perfect while the board still renders the retracted BODY.
//
// So this asserts the LEDGER — the exact set of places that touch the table, and
// which constant each is required to go through. It fails if the set GROWS (a new
// query nobody redacted) or SHRINKS (a query removed, so a behavioural test may
// have gone quietly vacuous). It is a STRUCTURAL check and is deliberately paired
// with behavioural cases: internal/api's TestRetractedCommentBodyAbsentEverywhere
// walks the actual HTTP surfaces, and (PG-gated)
// TestPGStoreCommentSoftDeleteTombstonesBothReads measures the real SQL.
//
// 🔴 TWO DIFFERENT CONSTANTS, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The READS must go through
// `commentCols` — the projection that blanks a retracted body in Postgres — and
// must NOT carry `liveOnly`, because filtering the row out is exactly the
// silently-shortening-thread behaviour this design rejects. The WRITES must carry
// `liveOnly` (AddComment guards on a live parent; SoftDeleteComment guards on a
// live comment AND a live parent). A read that swapped to liveOnly, or a write
// that dropped it, is a different bug and each is caught below.
//
// 🔴 IT READS STRING LITERALS, NOT FILE TEXT. A first version grepped the raw
// source and was wrong twice over: every doc COMMENT that mentions the table
// counted as a query site, and no site counted as filtered because the predicate
// is concatenated in as a CONSTANT, so the literal "deleted_at IS NULL" appears in
// none of them. Both errors point the same direction — a text grep over code is a
// claim about the text.

// commentSite is the required constant usage for one function's SQL.
type commentSite struct {
	// liveOnly is whether the function's body must reference the liveOnly
	// predicate constant.
	liveOnly bool
	// commentCols is whether it must reference the redacting projection constant.
	commentCols bool
}

// wantCommentSites is the ledger. Update it DELIBERATELY, with the behavioural
// test to match — never merely to make this test green again.
var wantCommentSites = map[string]commentSite{
	// Read #1: the per-note thread (Get → the task view, GET /api/tasks/{id}).
	// Redacts, does NOT filter — a retracted comment stays in the thread as a
	// tombstone so the thread cannot silently shorten.
	"ListComments": {liveOnly: false, commentCols: true},
	// Read #2: the batched board fan-out (List/ListByTags → GET /api/tasks,
	// /ui/tasks). Same rule, and it has to be the same constant or the two drift.
	"listCommentsForNotes": {liveOnly: false, commentCols: true},
	// Write: the INSERT, guarded on a LIVE PARENT (a comment on a dismissed task
	// would otherwise be written into a thread nothing can see).
	"AddComment": {liveOnly: true, commentCols: false},
	// Write: the retraction itself — the only writer of note_comments.deleted_at.
	"SoftDeleteComment": {liveOnly: true, commentCols: false},
	// Write + a NON-BODY probe: the idle-task reaper's single statement. It INSERTs
	// the reap comment (hence liveOnly — a dismissed task must not gain one, same
	// rule as AddComment) and it also SCANS note_comments in a `NOT EXISTS` to
	// decide whether this task has already been reaped since its last activity.
	//
	// 🔴 THAT SCAN IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* THROUGH commentCols, and the reason is the
	// opposite of a leak: it selects no columns at all. It reads only `author` and
	// `created_at` inside an EXISTS, never `body`, so there is nothing for the
	// redacting projection to redact — adding commentCols here would be cargo cult.
	//
	// 🔴 It also deliberately does NOT filter `deleted_at IS NULL`. A RETRACTED reap
	// comment must still suppress the next reap: filtering it out would let an
	// operator who retracts the notice re-arm the reaper, and the next 30-minute
	// sweep would post a fresh one — a retract/repost loop. Behavioural case:
	// TestFlagIdleStaysSuppressedByARetractedReapComment.
	"FlagIdle": {liveOnly: true, commentCols: false},
	// NOT a comment read: the board's ACTIVITY ORDERING. Its lateral selects
	// `max(note_comments.created_at)` and no comment column at all, so there is no
	// body for commentCols to redact — which is why commentCols is false here and
	// why that is not the drift this ledger warns about elsewhere. (It does
	// PREDICATE on `c.author`, to exclude ReapCommentAuthor — see FlagIdle above
	// and TestReapedTaskDoesNotFloatToTheTopOfTheBoard — but predicating on a
	// column is not selecting one, so that does not change either flag.)
	//
	// ⚠ READ THE liveOnly FLAG NARROWLY HERE, AND ONLY HERE. It is true because
	// ListPage references the constant for the NOTES predicate (`n.`+liveOnly);
	// the AST detector matches an identifier, so it cannot tell which table the
	// predicate is applied to. So this entry does NOT assert anything about
	// comment filtering, and it would stay green if someone added a comment-level
	// `deleted_at IS NULL` to that lateral. What covers THAT is behavioural, not
	// structural: TestListPageRetractedCommentStillFloatsTheTask (PG-gated) puts a
	// retracted comment on a task and requires it to keep its position — because
	// a retraction must not silently sink a task down the board, for the same
	// reason a retracted comment tombstones instead of vanishing.
	"ListPage": {liveOnly: true, commentCols: false},

//
