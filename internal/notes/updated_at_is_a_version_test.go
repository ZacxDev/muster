// TestUpdatedAtIsAMonotonicCardVersion pins the property the UI's stale-card
// guard RESTS ON, in the one place that can actually make the claim: Postgres.
//
// 🔴 WHY IT MATTERS OUTSIDE THIS PACKAGE. internal/ui renders every task card
// with data-card-rev = notes.updated_at in nanoseconds, and resyncScript refuses
// a morph:outerHTML into #task-{id} whose rev is STRICTLY OLDER than the one on
// screen. That is what stops the SSE-triggered re-fetch of a dispatch — issued
// before the dispatch's own status write commits — from landing on top of the
// authoritative answer and putting `open` back on a task the store has as
// `in_progress`.
//
// The guard is only sound if updated_at moves FORWARD with the task's own data,
// and only the store can be asked. Both directions are checked:
//
//   - SetStatus and AddComment must ADVANCE it (they write `updated_at=now()` in
//     the same statement as the change), or a genuinely newer card would tie with
//     the one on screen and the ordering would be back to last-arrival-wins;
//   - and it must never go BACKWARDS, or the guard would drop the fresh card.
//
// PG-gated exactly like the rest of this file's tests: without
// MUSTER_TEST_DATABASE_URL there is no store to ask, and a fake would only
// restate what the fake was written to do.
