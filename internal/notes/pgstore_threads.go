// sessionCols is the SINGLE task_sessions projection every link read uses, so the
// per-task read, the batched board read and the reverse lookup can never drift out
// of sync with scanSessionLinkInto's target order — exactly as noteCols does for
// notes.
//
// 🔴 THIS PACKAGE NO LONGER READS THE SESSION RECORD AT ALL, AND THAT IS A
// DEPENDENCY-DIRECTION RULE, NOT A TIDY-UP. This projection used to carry a
// `(… IS NOT NULL)` expression off a LEFT JOIN, which is where
// SessionLink.DetailAvailable came from. That table belongs to another service
// and is not in this schema, so a read of it from here — in SQL or in Go — is
// precisely the cross-service dependency this package was carved out to remove.
//
// What that costs, and who pays it: DetailAvailable is now the ZERO VALUE on
// everything this package returns, and the API layer composes it (see
// api.withSessionLiveness). It is NOT optional enrichment — false renders "no
// transcript recorded" over a session whose transcript is alive, which is the
// conflation that disguised a ~2.5-month Stop-hook outage as ordinary retention.
// Any new caller of this package's link reads composes liveness or renders a lie.
//
// ts.detail_seen is the STORED half and is unaffected: it is a real column
// recording whether a transcript was ever OBSERVED for this link.
// Its observation now arrives as an ARGUMENT to LinkSession instead of being probed
// in SQL. One bit without the other cannot tell "reaped" from "never recorded" —
// see SessionLink.DetailSeen.
const sessionCols = `ts.session_id, ts.role, ts.project, ts.cwd, ts.host, ts.first_seen_at, ts.last_seen_at, ts.detail_seen`

// sessionFrom is the FROM clause sessionCols is written against.
const sessionFrom = `FROM task_sessions ts`

// scanSessionLinkInto returns the Scan destinations for sessionCols, in order.
//
// 🔴 THIS AND sessionCols ARE ONE UNIT — change them in the SAME edit. Their order
// is the whole contract, and Postgres will happily scan a value into the wrong
// field of the same type.
//
// 🔴 SessionLink.DetailAvailable IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT FROM THIS LIST. It has no
// column and no expression behind it any more; it is composed at the API layer
// from the other service's session record. Adding a destination for it here would
// need a source, and the only source is the JOIN this package dropped.
func scanSessionLinkInto(l *SessionLink) []any {

}

// detailSeenUpgradeExpr is the MONOTONIC merge on conflict — the detail_seen twin of
// roleUpgradeExpr. A plain assignment would let a touch made after the 14-day sweep
// reset a link that HAD been observed back to false, which is precisely the
// "recorded then reaped" state the column exists to remember.
const detailSeenUpgradeExpr = `(task_sessions.detail_seen OR EXCLUDED.detail_seen)`

// lastSeenCoalesce is how stale a link's last_seen_at must be before an otherwise
// unchanged touch is allowed to rewrite it.
//
// 🔴 IT EXISTS BECAUSE A SAFE METHOD NOW WRITES. GET /api/tasks/{id} records a
// `read` link, and `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` produces a dead tuple on every
// execution — even when every column is assigned its own current value — so a
// polled task would accumulate one dead tuple per read and hand the whole cost to
// autovacuum. Five minutes keeps last_seen_at useful for the reverse lookup's
// ordering (which is a human-scale "what did this session work on") while
// collapsing a burst of reads into at most one write.
//
// A ROLE UPGRADE, NEW CONTEXT, or a detail_seen FALSE→TRUE transition always writes
// regardless of this window — those are real changes, and delaying them would lose
// information rather than defer it.
//
// 🔴 THE detail_seen CLAUSE IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DEFENSIVE. Leaving it out of the
// `DO UPDATE … WHERE` would suppress exactly the transition detail_seen exists
// to capture, and would do it silently: the link's other columns genuinely have not
// changed, so the coalesce would refuse the write, the read-back path would return
// the OLD detail_seen, and a session whose transcript had just been recorded would
// keep rendering "no transcript recorded" — for up to five minutes, and in the
// common case forever, because a task is rarely touched again.
const lastSeenCoalesce = 5 * time.Minute

// quotedRoleRead is RoleRead as a SQL literal, derived from the Go constant so the
// eviction query cannot drift from the vocabulary. Spelling 'read' inline would be
// a second definition.
var quotedRoleRead = "'" + RoleRead + "'"

// roleUpgradeExpr is the SINGLE SQL expression enforcing the monotonic role rule
// on an upsert: the resulting role is whichever of (existing, incoming) sits
// further along ['read','worked','created'].
//
// 🔴 This is the Postgres MIRROR of roleRank/UpgradeRole in threads.go and the
// array's ORDER IS THE CONTRACT — reversing it, or dropping an element, silently
// turns "never downgrade" into "always take the newest", which no CHECK constraint
// would catch. TestRoleRankMatchesSQLOrdering pins the two orderings together and
// TestPGLinkSessionRoleIsMonotonic exercises this expression against a real
// database in both directions.
//
// GREATEST ignores NULLs, so an unrecognised role on either side degrades to the
// other one rather than nulling the column; the CHECK constraint and ValidRole
// already make that unreachable.
const roleUpgradeExpr = `(ARRAY['read','worked','created'])[GREATEST(
	array_position(ARRAY['read','worked','created'], task_sessions.role),
	array_position(ARRAY['read','worked','created'], EXCLUDED.role))]`

// LinkSession records that a coding-agent session touched a task, upserting the
// (note_id, session_id) edge and returning the resulting link plus whether
// anything OBSERVABLE changed (a new row, or a role upgrade — not a bare
// last_seen_at touch, which callers must not broadcast on).
//
// 🔴 A PROVENANCE BREADCRUMB MUST NEVER BREAK THE OPERATION IT ANNOTATES. The
// first version of this function enforced the per-task session cap as a HARD bound
// in the upsert's WHERE and answered ErrTooManySessions, which callers turned into
// a 409. Two defects fell straight out of that, both measured on a live server:
//
//   - A SPLIT WRITE. PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/status applied the status change and
//     THEN failed the link, so the caller was told `409 session thread is full`
//     about a request that had already succeeded (open → in_progress).
//   - A PERMANENT READ LOCKOUT. Once 50 distinct sessions had read a task, every
//     further session's plain GET answered 409 forever, because links are never
//     pruned. The documented escape hatch (omit the header) stopped being reachable
//     the moment the CLI started sending it unconditionally.
//
// So the cap is now ADVISORY and BEST-EFFORT, and this function CANNOT fail a
// request on account of it. The mechanism is INSERT-THEN-TRIM:
//
//  1. Upsert unconditionally (subject only to the live-parent guard).
//  2. Trim the thread back to MaxTaskSessions by evicting the oldest `read` links.
//     `created` and `worked` are NEVER evicted — they are the rows that record work.
//
// The row just written is by construction the NEWEST `read` link, so it is evicted
// LAST: it goes only when every other link is `created`/`worked`, i.e. when nothing
// else is evictable — which is exactly the "skip the link" case, arrived at as a
// consequence of the ordering rather than as a special case. That is reported as
// ErrTooManySessions, which callers LOG AND COUNT and never surface.
//
// Insert-then-trim also demotes the concurrency defect the audit measured (the old
// pre-check read the same MVCC snapshot as the INSERT, so 49 + 12 concurrent
// writers produced 57 rows). A racy HARD bound is a defect; a racy ADVISORY one is
// fine, and the trim is self-correcting — the next link on that task brings the
// count back down. This is emphatically NOT a security bound on attacker-influenced
// input; see MaxTaskSessions.
//
// The remaining properties, unchanged:
//
//   - LIVE PARENT ONLY, via the same `liveOnly` predicate every other write goes
//     through, spelled as a `WHERE EXISTS` exactly like AddComment. A dismissed
//     task must not gain a link: the FK still points at the surviving row, so a
//     bare upsert would write an edge into a thread nothing can see. Unknown or
//     dismissed id → pgx.ErrNoRows.
//   - MONOTONIC ROLE, via roleUpgradeExpr.
//   - MONOTONIC detail_seen, via detailSeenUpgradeExpr: every touch ORs the
//     caller's fresh `detailSeen` observation in, so the link records that a
//     transcript was once observed and keeps recording it after the 14-day sweep
//     removes the row. A plain assignment would reset it to false on the first
//     post-sweep touch, turning "expired" back into "never recorded".
//   - FIRST_SEEN_AT IS IMMUTABLE — absent from the DO UPDATE SET list.
//   - The denormalised context columns are only OVERWRITTEN by a non-empty incoming
//     value, so a context-less touch cannot blank what an earlier one recorded.
//
// 🔴 COALESCED last_seen_at (the reason for the `DO UPDATE … WHERE`). GET
// /api/tasks/{id} is a SAFE method that now writes, and `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
// creates a dead tuple on EVERY execution even when every column is set to its own
// value — so a polled task would generate one dead tuple per read forever. The
// WHERE clause makes the update genuinely CONDITIONAL: a repeat touch that neither
// upgrades the role nor carries new context, inside lastSeenCoalesce of the
// previous one, updates NO ROW AT ALL. RETURNING then yields nothing, which is why
// the caller re-reads (see the coalesced branch below) rather than treating an
// empty result as a refusal.
//
// 🔴 detailSeen IS AN INPUT, NOT A PROBE, AND THE CALLER OWNS THE OBSERVATION.
// It answers "does a transcript record for l.SessionID exist RIGHT NOW", which this
// package used to ask in SQL (an `EXISTS` probe of the transcript table) and no
// longer may: that table belongs to another service and is not in this schema.
// It is a PARAMETER rather than a field on l so that adding it could not be
// silently skipped — every caller had to be recompiled and had to decide.
//
// Two consequences worth stating rather than discovering:
//
//   - PASSING false IS ALWAYS SAFE FOR THE STORED COLUMN. detailSeenUpgradeExpr
//     ORs it in, so a caller whose probe FAILED (or that has no session store at
//     all) can pass false and cannot thereby erase a true that was recorded
//     earlier. A failed probe degrades to "learned nothing", never to "unlearned".
//   - IT DOES NOT SET SessionLink.DetailAvailable ON THE RETURNED LINK. This
//     package no longer fills that field anywhere; the API layer composes it from
//     the same observation it passed in. See api.withSessionLiveness.
