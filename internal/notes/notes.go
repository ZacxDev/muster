// Package notes is the persistence domain for TASKS — the table is called
// `notes` and every id in it is a task number people cite, so the name is kept
// rather than migrated. It owns the task rows, their comments, their
// attachments, their tags, their status transitions and the thread of sessions
// that touched them.
//
// 🔴 IT IMPORTS EXACTLY ONE PACKAGE FROM THIS MODULE, AND THAT IS A LEDGER, NOT
// AN ACCIDENT: internal/taskstatus, for the lifecycle vocabulary — which itself
// imports nothing. Everything else a task is
// ASSOCIATED with — the session that produced it, the permission decisions that
// name its directory, the agent that worked it — lives in another package or
// another service, and is composed at the API layer rather than joined here.
// extraction_seam_test.go fails if that set changes, in either direction, and
// it fails on SOURCE rather than on the type checker, because the dependencies
// that matter here are SQL joins and they are invisible to the compiler.

//
//   - 🔴 NOTHING ELSE MAY AUTHOR A COMMENT UNDER THIS NAME. A second writer using
//     it would silently suppress reaps on every task it commented on, and the
//     failure is invisible (a task that is never flagged looks exactly like a task
//     that is not idle). Pinned by api.TestReapCommentAuthorIsUnclaimable, which
//     covers BOTH routes to a comment author: the hardcoded one (via the shared
//     privilegedAuthorSites scanner, which also backs
//     TestPrivilegedAuthorSitesAreLedgered) and the DERIVED one (taskSourceAllowlist
//     must not contain this value, or a machine could claim it with one header).
//   - Its VALUE is frozen at "system" on purpose. Changing it would orphan every
//     reap the previous implementation recorded and hand the whole existing board
//     one fresh round of comments.
//
// 🔴 WHAT THIS DOES *NOT* COVER: the `stale` TAG. Nothing removes that tag
// AUTOMATICALLY — no sweep, no status change, no comment handler clears it, so
// once a task has been flagged the chip stays on the card even after the task is
// worked on again. Read it as "this task has been idle at least once", NOT as
// "this task is idle now"; the per-event truth is in the thread, where each reap
// posts its own dated comment.
//
// ⚠ "Automatically" is the whole qualifier, and an earlier version of this
// comment dropped it and was wrong three ways. An OPERATOR has three routes to
// remove it, all live: the machine `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` with `removeTags`
// (api/notes.go), the routed `DELETE /tasks/{id}/tags/{tag}` (server.go →
// api/tags.go, both RemoveTags callers — there is no "merge path" caller), and
// the Edit modal's `POST /tasks/{id}/edit`, which submits the whole tag set
// through UpdateNote's REPLACE semantics and so drops any chip the operator
// deleted. api.staleTaskTag says the same thing about the Edit modal; these two
// comments must agree.
//
// None of that changes the design, because re-flagging keys off this comment
// marker rather than the tag — see FlagIdle — so an operator clearing the chip
// neither re-arms nor disarms the reaper. What it does change is the ARGUMENT: a
// tag-presence predicate is rejected because the tag is only ever cleared by a
// deliberate operator action, so a task nobody edits could never be re-flagged
// however long it later sat idle, and that failure is invisible (a task that is
// never flagged looks exactly like a task that is not idle). Not because the tag
// is unremovable.
//
// Leaving it un-cleared by the reaper is a DELIBERATE choice. The rejected
// alternative was an auto-un-stale sweep, which would have been a mass write over
// live rows driven by `updated_at`, the very field this change exists because it
// is corrupted on 180 of them; clearing the tag on those is the operator's call,
// not the reaper's.

	// reaper that used AddTags+AddComment was writing to the field it measures:
	// each sweep reset the 7-day idle clock on everything it touched, so the same
	// population re-reaped forever in growing batches, and because the sweep
	// iterates the list in `updated_at DESC` order and bumps each row in turn, the
	// MOST idle task was bumped LAST and sorted HIGHEST — the board's order came
	// out inverted against real activity. Measured on the live board: 186 of 293
	// tasks in same-second clusters, correlation between the stamped updated_at
	// and true last activity −0.948.

	// 🔴 THE NON-BUMP IS ONLY SAFE BECAUSE THE "ALREADY REAPED" TEST MOVED HERE.
	// The bump was doing double duty: after it, the task no longer satisfied
	// `updated_at < cutoff`, which is the ONLY reason the old reaper did not
	// re-comment on every pass. Remove the bump alone and the tag stays idempotent
	// (set-union) but the COMMENT does not — the sweep would append a duplicate
	// system comment forever. So this method carries its own predicate instead:
	//
	//	reap iff the task has NO ReapCommentAuthor comment created AFTER its
	//	current updated_at.
	//
	// That is the honest spelling of "has this task been reaped since its last
	// genuine activity?", and it is strictly better than testing for the tag:
	//
	//   - Exactly one comment per idle period. A second sweep finds the first
	//     comment's created_at newer than the (unmoved) updated_at and writes
	//     nothing.
	//   - RE-FLAGGING STILL WORKS. A real write bumps updated_at past the old reap
	//     comment, so after another full idle window the task is eligible again.
	//     A tag-absence predicate could not do this — nothing removes the tag —
	//     and would have made every reaped task un-flaggable forever.
	//   - It recognises reaps performed by the PREVIOUS implementation, which
	//     authored the same comment, so the existing board does not get a fresh
	//     round of comments. 🔴 That requires the comparison to be `>=`, not `>`:
	//     the old reaper's AddComment wrote the comment's created_at and the row's
	//     updated_at in ONE statement, so they are EQUAL, and a strict `>` would
	//     have re-reaped every already-flagged task on the first sweep after
	//     deploy. See PGStore.FlagIdle.
	//   - Two processes racing it cannot both insert — but 🔴 NOT because the
	//     predicate shares the write's statement. That reasoning was measured
	//     FALSE (the `NOT EXISTS` subplan reads the statement's original snapshot,
	//     so the loser does not see the winner's comment). What makes it safe is
	//     the explicit row lock PGStore.FlagIdle takes in a preceding command; the
	//     leader gate does NOT cover this, because it is a per-process lease and
	//     reapIdleTasks has two in-process callers.
	//
	// RETRACTED reap comments still COUNT. Filtering them out would let an
	// operator who retracts the comment make the task eligible again, and the next
	// sweep would post a new one — a retract/repost loop. Suppression is the safe
	// direction.

	// 🔴 THIS IS THE ONE COMMENT WRITER THAT IS INVISIBLE TO updated_at, so a reap
	// is deliberately not "activity". Any read that derives a task's activity time
	// or board position from note_comments.created_at must EXCLUDE
	// ReapCommentAuthor, or reaping a task floats it to the top of the board and
	// reintroduces the inverted ordering this method exists to remove. See
	// PGStore.FlagIdle.
	//
	// ✅ SATISFIED IN-TREE, not outstanding: the only such reader is the board's
	// activity ordering in PGStore.ListPage, whose comment lateral carries
	// `AND c.author <> ReapCommentAuthor`. The paragraph above is the rule a FUTURE
	// reader must follow, not a TODO. Behavioural pin:
	// TestReapedTaskDoesNotFloatToTheTopOfTheBoard.
	//
	// The `stale` TAG is never removed AUTOMATICALLY — only by a deliberate
	// operator action; see ReapCommentAuthor for what that means and why
	// re-flagging does not depend on it. Unknown, dismissed, or already-reaped
	// id → (false, nil), never an error: "nothing to do" is not a failure. A store
	// error → (false, err).

	// SoftDeleteComment retracts ONE comment from a task's thread by stamping
	// note_comments.deleted_at  instead of deleting the row. It is
	// the comment-scoped twin of SoftDelete and carries the same contract:
	//
	//   - The comment's BODY disappears from every read — Get's thread, the batched
	//     board read behind List/ListByTags, and therefore both the HTML card and
	//     the machine JSON. The comment itself stays in the thread as a TOMBSTONE
	//     (Retracted true, Body empty) so the thread cannot silently shorten, and
	//     the row (the evidence) survives for a DB-level undo.
	//   - Scoped by BOTH the task id and the comment id, so a comment can only be
	//     retracted through the thread it actually belongs to.
	//   - An unknown comment id, a comment belonging to a DIFFERENT task, a comment
	//     already retracted, and a comment on a DISMISSED task all answer
	//     pgx.ErrNoRows — which is what keeps a repeat DELETE a 404 rather than a
	//     200, matching DELETE /api/tasks/{id}.
	//
	// There is no Restore twin: comment recovery, like task recovery, is
	// store/DB-level only and no HTTP route exposes it.
