// verdict.mjs — read Playwright's JSON report and refuse a run that proves
// nothing.
//
// 🔴 A COUNT, NOT AN EXIT CODE. `playwright test` exits 0 when every test
// skipped, and a suite pointed at no database skips by design. This prints the
// PAIR (how many passed, how many skipped) and fails when fewer than FLOOR tests
// passed or more than CAP skipped.
//
// FLOOR is the number of tests in e2e/tests/ as written at the commit that
// introduced this file (measured: every one passes against a seeded database
// — see the PR). A floor below the real count is indistinguishable from no
// floor, so when a spec is added, raise it in the same change.
